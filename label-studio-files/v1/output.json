Us:\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays).\nAbout The Role:\nRemember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds—without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.\nWhat You'll Do:\nYou'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build a tool that allows admins to manage all their workspaces at once. \nYou'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might optimize our block data model.\nYou'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include building dashboards and alerting to ensure that our features are reliable.\nWhat We're Looking For:\nThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\nShipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.\nFamiliarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together—from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.\nPragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff—you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\nPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact—good and bad.\nNot ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\nEmpathetic communication: You communicate nuanced ideas clearly, whether you're explaining technical decisions in writing or brainstorming in real time. In disagreements, you engage thoughtfully with other perspectives and compromise when needed.\nTeam player: You understand when work is better, together. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\nBonus Points:\nYou're proficient with any part of our technology stack: React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Postgres.\nYou have prior experience working on Enterprise systems: SAML, SCIM, eDiscovery, Access control mechanisms like RBAC, and more.\nYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\nYou have interests outside of technology, such as in art, history, or social sciences.\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you’re excited about a role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you’re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristic. Notion considers qualified applicants with criminal histories, consistent with applicable federal, state and local law. Notion is also committed to providing reasonable accommodations for qualified individuals with disabilities and disabled veterans in our job application procedures. If you need assistance or an accommodation due to a disability, please let your recruiter know.\nNotion is committed to providing highly competitive cash compensation, equity, and benefits.

Mixpanel\nMixpanel is event analytics platform for builders who need answers from their data at their fingertips—no SQL required. When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions.\nOver 8,000 customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, Samsara, and Uber, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all.We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org! \nAbout the Role\nMixpanel is powered by a custom distributed database. This system ingests more than 1 Trillion user-generated events every month while ensuring end-to-end latencies of under a minute and queries typically scan more than 1 Quadrillion events over the span of a month. Over the last year, our inbound traffic has doubled. As our existing customers grow in volume and we add new ones, we expect this growth in traffic to continue. The Distributed Systems engineering teams are responsible for adding new capabilities and ensuring the smooth operation of the underlying systems.\nResponsibilities\nMixpanel's infrastructure runs on Google Cloud Platform. We rely on Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services. We primarily use Golang for writing services and all internal communication happens via GRPC. We use a combination of C and C++ wherever Golang doesn't meet our performance goals.\nAs an engineer on the Distributed Systems teams, you'll be responsible for:\nWorking with other engineers to build distributed systems that can handle data at scale\nDebugging production issues across multiple services and all levels of our infrastructure stack\nEnsuring reliability and uptime of the services you're responsible for\nKeeping an eye on how much your service costs every month and removing inefficiencies wherever possible\nImproving engineering standards and holding a high bar for code quality and simplicity\nPushing the boundaries on how our customers analyze their product data\nA typical project requires a thorough understanding of how not just your service works but also how it interacts with other components. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.\nMost of the systems in our stack provide at least once semantics. As a result, we risk duplicating events that flow through them. To overcome this limitation, we added support for event deduplication that can work at our scale. Typical approaches for deduplication don't perform well on large amounts of data, so we had to do something highly custom for our stack. We wrote about this on our engineering blog here.\nBack in 2019, we migrated our ingestion API service from Python to Golang for better performance and type safety. We had to do this while ensuring that both systems handle data the same way. Because we had to compare, both, HTTP responses and transformed payloads, nothing out of the box worked for us. This blog post talks about how we did the actual migration without any customer visible downtime.\nIn 2021, as our traffic grew almost 100%, the cost of storing data became untenable. Our engineers worked on an incremental way to eventually realize almost $30000 in savings per month.\nIf projects like the ones listed above excite you, the Distributed Systems engineering team will be a great fit.\nWe're Looking For Someone Who Has\nWe have openings across multiple distributed systems teams.

It is the policy of ELEVI to provide equal employment opportunities to all employees and employment applicants—without regard to unlawful considerations of race, religion, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, sensory, physical or mental disability, marital status, veteran or military status, genetic information, or any other classification protected by applicable local, state, or federal laws. We fearlessly drive change, because without diversity of thought and a commitment to equality for all, there is no moving forward. Reasonable accommodations are available for qualified individuals with disabilities, upon request. This policy applies to all aspects of employment, including, but not limited to, hiring, job assignment, compensation, promotion, benefits, training, discipline, and termination."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2023-11-27T10:48:45.283989Z","updated_at":"2023-11-27T11:24:11.243600Z","inner_id":1162,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":1,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":14167,"annotations":[{"id":124,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":925,"end":935,"text":"passionate","labels":["SOFT_SKILL"]},"id":"EYDGNMmeax","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"prediction"},{"value":{"start":1829,"end":1837,"text":"big
