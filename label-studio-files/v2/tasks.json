      "text": "About Us:\nWe're on a mission to make it possible for every person, team, and company to be able to tailor their software to solve any problem and take on any challenge. Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays).\nAbout The Role:\nRemember the first time you solved a problem by programming? The delight and excitement you felt when it finally...worked? We want to deliver that experience to everyone by giving them the building blocks to create useful tools of all kinds\u2014without needing to code. That's been the vision of computing pioneers since the 70s. Today, all the infrastructure is present, but we need your engineering to pull it off.\nWhat You'll Do:\nYou'll work with others to build new product features from start to finish: through conception, research, implementation, and maintenance. For example, you might build a tool that allows admins to manage all their workspaces at once. \nYou'll help improve performance and reliability, or polish existing features. For example, you might optimize our block data model.\nYou'll build internal tools to support simplicity and productivity for the whole team. This might include building dashboards and alerting to ensure that our features are reliable.\nWhat We're Looking For:\nThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\nShipping quality user interfaces: You can work with others to build and maintain quality user interfaces for a big audience, using Web technologies like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, and a modern UI framework like React. If you've experienced the technical challenges of rapid growth, that's a plus.\nFamiliarity with the backend: You understand how parts of a system fit together\u2014from the user interface to the data model. Experienced candidates should be familiar with relational database systems like Postgres or MySQL.\nPragmatic and business-oriented: You care about the business impact of what you're building, and you prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff\u2014you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\nPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact\u2014good and bad.\nNot ideological about technology: To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs.

      "text": "About Mixpanel\nMixpanel is event analytics platform for builders who need answers from their data at their fingertips\u2014no SQL required. When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions.\nOver 8,000 customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, Samsara, and Uber, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all.We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org! \nAbout the Role\nMixpanel is powered by a custom distributed database. This system ingests more than 1 Trillion user-generated events every month while ensuring end-to-end latencies of under a minute and queries typically scan more than 1 Quadrillion events over the span of a month. Over the last year, our inbound traffic has doubled. As our existing customers grow in volume and we add new ones, we expect this growth in traffic to continue. The Distributed Systems engineering teams are responsible for adding new capabilities and ensuring the smooth operation of the underlying systems.\nResponsibilities\nMixpanel's infrastructure runs on Google Cloud Platform. We rely on Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services. We primarily use Golang for writing services and all internal communication happens via GRPC. We use a combination of C and C++ wherever Golang doesn't meet our performance goals.\nAs an engineer on the Distributed Systems teams, you'll be responsible for:\nWorking with other engineers to build distributed systems that can handle data at scale\nDebugging production issues across multiple services and all levels of our infrastructure stack\nEnsuring reliability and uptime of the services you're responsible for\nKeeping an eye on how much your service costs every month and removing inefficiencies wherever possible\nImproving engineering standards and holding a high bar for code quality and simplicity\nPushing the boundaries on how our customers analyze their product data\nA typical project requires a thorough understanding of how not just your service works but also how it interacts with other components. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.\nMost of the systems in our stack provide at least once semantics. As a result, we risk duplicating events that flow through them. To overcome this limitation, we added support for event deduplication that can work at our scale. Typical approaches for deduplication don't perform well on large amounts of data, so we had to do something highly custom for our stack. We wrote about this on our engineering blog here.\nBack in 2019, we migrated our ingestion API service from Python to Golang for better performance and type safety. We had to do this while ensuring that both systems handle data the same way. Because we had to compare, both, HTTP responses and transformed payloads, nothing out of the box worked for us. This blog post talks about how we did the actual migration without any customer visible downtime.\nIn 2021, as our traffic grew almost 100%, the cost of storing data became untenable. Our engineers worked on an incremental way to eventually realize almost $30000 in savings per month.\nIf projects like the ones listed above excite you, the Distributed Systems engineering team will be a great fit.\nWe're Looking For Someone Who Has\nWe have openings across multiple distributed systems teams. We're looking for engineers who have:\nA strong grasp of computer science fundamentals when it comes to dealing with distributed systems and networks. You'll routinely run into issues where \"one in a million\" chances actually happen in production\nA knack for problem-solving and thinking from first principles. You don't shy away from any problem, no matter the scale or impact\nA bias towards shipping early and iterating. We believe in making small incremental changes to existing systems instead of large multi-quarter undertakings\nExperience building distributed systems or is eager to build that skillset\nAdditional Resources \nEngineering Life Page \nTracking events at millisecond granularity\nEnsuring Data Consistency Across Replicas\nSaving $30000 a month by improving Garbage Collection\nStrategies For Effective Data Compaction\nMonitoring Apache Kafka with JMX Exporter and Kafka Exporter\nResharding petabytes of data to improve performance for our largest customers\nCompensation\nThe total target cash compensation (TTCC) for this full-time position would fall within the bands below. This amount includes base compensation and variable compensation in the form of either a company bonus or commissions. Variable compensation type is determined by your role and level. In addition to the cash compensation provided below, this position is also eligible for equity consideration and other benefits including medical, vision, and dental insurance coverage. You can view our benefits offerings here.Senior Software Engineer, IC4 $219,500 - $268,500Staff Software Engineer, IC5 $255,000 - $345,000Leveling is determined by factors such as years of relevant work experience, level of responsibility, and knowledge required to be successful in the role.Our salary ranges are determined by role and level and are benchmarked to the SF Bay Area Technology data cut released by Radford, a global compensation database.

      "text": "At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldn\u2019t do this without hiring the best people. We\u2019re a group of hard-working overachievers who are deeply focused on building the future of finance and Web3 for our users across the globe, whether they\u2019re trading, storing, staking or using crypto. Know those people who always lead the group project? That\u2019s us.\nThere are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team. First, we look for candidates who will thrive in a culture like ours, where we default to trust, embrace feedback, and disrupt ourselves. Second, we expect all employees to commit to our mission-focused approach to our work. Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. We\u2019re a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.\nReady to #LiveCrypto? Who you are:\nYou\u2019ve got positive energy.

Our teams create high-quality work on quick timelines. Owning a problem doesn\u2019t scare you, but rather empowers you to take 100% responsibility for achieving our mission.\nYou want to be part of a winning team.
