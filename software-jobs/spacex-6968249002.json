Our suite of Ground Software applications is used by operators throughout the entire vehicle lifecycle. In your role, you will interface daily with: launch engineers commanding our fleet of Falcon rockets; mission control operators providing smooth flights for astronauts aboard Dragon; test engineers static firing Merlin engines; and offshore recovery engineers capturing spacecraft and rockets and bringing them safely back to shore. Each of these teams relies on the Ground Software user interfaces and backend control systems that you will create and support.You are the engineer other engineers can count on. You embrace every problem with enthusiasm. You remove hurdles, are a self-starter, team player. You have the hunger to venture into unknown areas and make the system work.Aerospace experience is not required to be successful here - rather we look for smart, motivated, collaborative engineers who love solving problems and want to make an impact on a super inspiring mission. You will have full ownership of challenging problems, working with a team of enthusiastic engineers designing solutions that propel SpaceX toward our goals at a rapid pace.
