Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nAbout The Role:\nMillions of people use Notion \u2014 and this number is increasing every day. That means millions of people trust us to deliver a fast, reliable, and secure experience, and we value this more than anything. We want to keep earning trust, while also continuing to amaze our users with the tools they can build in Notion.\nThe Cloud Infrastructure team is a new team tasked with architecting, delivering, and operating the foundational cloud environment that powers Notion. As a founding engineer on the team, you'll work on the fundamental infrastructure components that all other teams at Notion build upon to guide Notion through the next few years of growth.\nWhat You'll Achieve:\nHelp build a vision and roadmaps for this team, including Notion\u2019s strategy on service provisioning, disaster recovery, and environment isolation / consistency\nPartner closely with the broader engineering team to capacity plan and ensure an efficient and predictable cloud workload\nPartner with the security engineering team to harden Notion\u2019s cloud environment\nHelp drive large cross-functional projects, such as helping Notion achieve data residency in multiple data centers\nSkills You'll Need to Bring:\nInfrastructure & backend expertise: You\u2019re comfortable diving into any part of the system (application code, configuration, deployment pipeline, internal / external services and APIs), and you bring multiple years of expertise in a few of the following areas:\nCloud architecture / security group architecture (AWS, GCP, Azure)\nCloud cost efficiency / capacity planning / auto-scaling\nInfrastructure as code / terraform\nDebugging production systems\nNetworking / load balancing / CDN / proxies / caching\nContainerization, deployment, and config management\nRelational and non-relational database architecture and management\nIdentity and access management\nStartup mentality: You are comfortable navigating the fast moving, unstructured nature of a hyper-growth startup. You are self-motivated to add value and bias towards action. You understand the importance of setting the engineering quality bar for the long term success of our business, but are able to make difficult prioritizations.\nPragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You don't just go after cool stuff\u2014you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line. To you, technologies and programming languages are about tradeoffs. You may be opinionated, but you're not ideological and can learn new technologies as you go.\nNice to Haves:\nExperience in scaling a hyper-growth startup\nExperience building file storage and delivery infrastructure\nExperience with implementing robust backups and disaster recovery\nExperience with multi-region failovers or multi-datacenter deployments\nYou can drive multi-month projects end-to-end with minimal management and cross-functional support\nYou've managed, maintained, and monitored systems using Amazon Web Services, Datadog, Postgres, Redis, Memcached, and Elasticsearch.\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.
