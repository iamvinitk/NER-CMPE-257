Our products, business, and workplace culture have received numerous awards, such as being named to the Forbes Cloud 100 and a Fortune Best Workplace in Technology. Lucid is a hybrid workplace, allowing employees to work remotely, from one of our offices, or a combination of the two depending on the needs of the role and team. At Lucid, we hold true to our core values of teamwork over ego, innovation in everything we do, individual empowerment, initiative, and ownership, and passion and excellence in every area. We value diversity and are dedicated to creating an environment that is respectful and inclusive for everyone.In today\u2019s tech environment, strategic thinking must be paired with strong analytical skills. As an Analyst on Lucid\u2019s Strategy & Analytics team, you will be expected to be fluent in all aspects of strategic problem solving - from identifying opportunities to analyzing data, presenting results, and driving change. This role is designed for candidates who have already honed their technical skills working with data and are ready to take their careers to the next level.\nAnalysts on the Strategy & Analytics team support groups across the whole business, allowing you to see multiple sides of the business and expand your knowledge and experience. These groups include Marketing, Demand Generation, Sales Operations, Customer Experience, Product, and Strategy. The tool sets developed and used are similar across these functions, but each presents domain-specific challenges that will provide unique opportunities for learning.\nSome examples of past projects from our team include creating a customer health score to highlight at-risk accounts, identifying opportunities to accelerate product adoption at enterprise companies, creating tools to automate the analysis of A/B tests, finding ways to increase collaboration and virality of our product, and building dashboards to help sales reps target high-potential accounts.\nAlthough your day-to-day work will be with the function to which you are assigned, you will be well-supported by the rest of the Strategy & Analytics team. While we are distributed throughout the company, we maintain close ties by holding weekly team trainings, daily working sessions, and regular team activities. We help each other whenever possible, and with the collective efforts of the full team, there\u2019s rarely a question we can\u2019t answer.\nResponsibilities:\nWork with senior leaders and other stakeholders within various departments at Lucid\nIdentify and understand problems and opportunities\nCome up with data-driven recommendations\nImplement new initiatives that help grow the business\nOther duties as assigned\nRequirements:\nCompleted Bachelor's and/or Master\u2019s degree, ideally in a technical or quantitative field\n2+ years of data analysis experience\nProficient with SQL\nBasic understanding of statistics and hypothesis testing\nGreat communication skills, both written and verbal\nAble to think strategically and tackle open-ended problems\nDetail-oriented, organized, and a good team player\nPreferred Qualifications:\n4+ years of data analysis experience in a SaaS environment \nPassion for problem-solving - If you\u2019ve ever been so absorbed in a problem that your mind couldn\u2019t rest until you figured it out, you\u2019ll be in good company.\nWilling to help and be helped - Our impact comes only through helping others make better decisions using data. We recognize that we\u2019re stronger together - there\u2019s no shame in asking for help, we\u2019re not afraid to say \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d, and we actively seek feedback.\nDesire to learn - You\u2019ll often be answering questions that have never been answered before, which requires a high level of intellectual curiosity and an eagerness to dive into new problems, domains, tools, and techniques.\n#LI-DA1 #LI-Remote", "departments": [{"id": 4004666004, "name": "Analytics", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": 4004651004}], "offices": [{"id": 4002140004, "name": "South Jordan HQ", "location": "Salt Lake City, Utah, United States", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": null}], "compliance": [{"type": "eeoc", "questions": [], "description": "&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
