Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nNotion is an in person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of their week in the office (including a third day).\nAbout The Role:\nIn 2022, Notion acquired the next-generation calendar app, Cron. We\u2019re looking for a Software Engineer to join our small but nimble team to build innovative, AI-powered products that create the magic of \u201c1 + 1 = 3\u201d and showcase the best of using Cron and Notion together.\nWhat You'll Achieve:\nWe're looking for an experienced individual contributor who enjoys working alongside other experienced engineers and designers to iterate and build across the entire tech stack. We are open to candidates who can work across the entire stack, as well as those who may want to focus on a few specific domain areas, depending on their interests and experience.\nBuild the core, user-facing product. You'll build the product and everything behind the scenes from the ground up, having a huge and direct impact by shipping your work to users on prod daily.\nPrototype new AI capabilities. You\u2019ll work with Notion AI engineers to incorporate large language models (LLMs) into our products.\nUse modern web tech and influence the stack. We use React on the frontend, Node/Express on the backend, and Typescript across the full stack to build a best-in-class client and infrastructure that scales. As we build out our stack, you get to make critical choices and lay the foundations.\nSelf-direct your work and co-own the product. You'll have autonomy and responsibility because we are all individual contributors. You'll be involved in shaping the roadmap and owning the execution of it.\nCreate a robust and scalable backend. Build PostgreSQL database models, performant REST API with Redis cache, delta sync, and offline support using IndexedDB, 3rd party integrations, product analytics, transactional email, and service monitoring. We currently deploy to Heroku to keep DevOps simple, but we have plans to move to a cloud provider and we\u2019ll look to you to help establish viable long-term cloud infrastructure and operations.\nBuild UI components. You'll implement basic UI based on Figma mocks and our design system. You'll collaborate with designers and frontend engineers on user-facing features powered by your backend code. We rapidly ship UI that has a native feel to it by polishing CSS, interaction states, and animations.\nSolve interesting technical problems. Bring your full creativity to solve super-challenging technical problems: from complex backend architecture with 3rd party integrations, real-time collaboration, syncing app state, to nifty client-side interactions.\nWhat We're Looking For:\nYou have 5+ years of engineering experience\nDemonstrated ability to execute with excellence: You have thrived in fast-paced environments, tackling complex technical challenges with exceptional skill and precision.\nThoughtful problem-solving: For you, problem-solving starts with a clear and accurate understanding of the context. You can decompose tricky problems and work towards a clean solution, by yourself or with teammates. You're comfortable asking for help when you get stuck.\nCurious and quick learning. We don't expect you to have experience in every technology we use, but to learn and be productive quickly. Owning several repos and jumping into all of them doesn't scare you.\nDesign sensibility. While you'll co-craft the interface with top designers and frontend engineers, we expect you to have a knack for great UX, such that you feel if something is off and can flag it, or better yet, polish it.\nPragmatic and business-oriented: You care about business impact and prioritize projects accordingly. You're not just going after cool stuff\u2014you understand the balance between craft, speed, and the bottom line.\nPut users first: You think critically about the implications of what you're building, and how it shapes real people's lives. You understand that reach comes with responsibility for our impact\u2014good and bad.\nTeam player: For you, work isn't a solo endeavor. You enjoy collaborating cross-functionally to accomplish shared goals, and you care about learning, growing, and helping others to do the same.\nBonus Points:\nYou\u2019re interested in productivity apps. You might use your calendar to time block, try out Chrome extensions, configure custom app launchers, or optimize your time in other ways.\nYou've built or maintained apps using React, React Native, Electron or other frameworks.\nYou have experience or interest in DevOps and the infrastructure side of building great software products.\nYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others\u2014and understand why we're big fans of their work.\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers. If you\u2019re excited about a role but your past experience doesn\u2019t align perfectly with every bullet point listed in the job description, we still encourage you to apply. If you\u2019re a builder at heart, share our company values, and enthusiastic about making software toolmaking ubiquitous, we want to hear from you.\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
