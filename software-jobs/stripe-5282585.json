Millions of companies\u2014from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups\u2014use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone\u2019s reach while doing the most important work of your career. \nAbout the team \nOur Revenue and Finance Automation (RFA) suite gives businesses power over the entire life cycle of their cash flow. By coordinating billing, tax, reporting, and data services in one modern stack, Stripe\u2019s revenue and finance automation suite eliminates the inefficiencies of legacy finance tools and supports revenue growth.\nWhile the internet has been a boon to productivity, the gains have been uneven. Common financial processes like billing, tax, and quarterly reporting are still painfully inefficient and manual. They\u2019re also typically spread across a dozen or more software tools. The result: one-third of finance leaders reopen their books at least once a quarter because of accounting errors, and half spend 10 hours a month manually correcting discrepancies.\nStripe\u2019s RFA suite relieves those burdens by equipping finance leaders with revenue management tools that are as sophisticated as the businesses they run. The suite automates manual work and improves accuracy across the cash flow life cycle, from payments and billing to tax, reporting, and reconciliation.\nOur portfolio is growing rapidly and we are expanding our RFA suite to serve the diverse spectrum of Stripe\u2019s users, from brand new startups to public companies. Simultaneously we are investing in foundations for an extensible platform solution, including integrations with external systems that will let us scale our reach and capabilities by orders of magnitude over the next few years.\nWhat you\u2019ll do\nWe\u2019re looking for a seasoned machine learning engineer to join our new ML accelerator team within RFA where you will help grow the use of applied ML and newer LLM-based models for building new products and capabilities.
