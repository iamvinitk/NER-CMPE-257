Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management and capital markets and insurance solutions. KKR aims to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in its portfolio companies and communities. KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds. KKR\u2019s insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life and reinsurance products under the management of The Global Atlantic Financial Group. As investors with an industrialist vision, we aim to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined approach, employing outstanding people, pursuing the highest standards of excellence, and aligning our interests with those of our investment partners. \nKKR seeks to create value by bringing operational expertise to its portfolio companies and through active oversight and monitoring of its investments. Today, KKR\u2019s portfolio of private equity investments consists of over 120 companies, including businesses such as ByteDance, Epic Games, Go Jek, Hitachi Kokusai, MYOB and First Data. KKR\u2019s approach to private equity investments is simple: the firm seeks to partner with strong management teams to build and grow great businesses over the long run. \nThat\u2019s the\u202ftechnical\u202fdescription of what we do, but on a more personal level, what we really do\u202fis work tirelessly to help teachers, firefighters, and millions of other hard working people across a whole range of industries turn their hard earned savings into a retirement account they can rely on to retire comfortably.\u202fThat is the core of what we do. We use our collective experience across a range of investment categories to help the users we serve retire well. And the global engineering organization is taking on an even more prominent role in that mission.\u202f \nKKR is investing in wide scale modernization of both our technology stack and the way we approach managing that technology. Our current footprint is a globally distributed technology portfolio deployed both in on-premise datacenters and within public cloud environments around the world.\u202f \nWe are moving toward becoming a product-centric organization that deploys code into production multiple times per day across hundreds of business systems. By \u201ccode,\u201d we mean everything from configuration, infrastructure (which we view as an extension of the product code base), product extensions / customizations, and core product code. Many of our systems are comprised of open-source and commercial products, and much of the complexity lies in the integration across these systems. \nUnderpinning KKR\u2019s success are two cultural characteristics: 1) an emphasis on innovation, creativity and continuous improvement and 2) a focus on operating as a single firm with a single culture with common attitudes and values that emphasize team-work, collaboration, integrity and shared success. \nThe Firm has over 1300 employees and KKR Capstone has over 45 executives. There are over 250 private market investment professionals and approximately 120 public market investment professionals. We conduct our business through our offices in 20+ cities, in 16 countries, and on five continents.
