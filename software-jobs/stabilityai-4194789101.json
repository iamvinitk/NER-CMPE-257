Our most considerable advances grow from our diversity in working across multiple teams and disciplines. We are unafraid to go against established norms and explore creativity. We are motivated to generate breakthrough ideas and convert them into tangible solutions. Our vibrant communities consist of experts, leaders and partners across the globe who are developing cutting-edge open AI models for Image, Language, Audio, Video, 3D and Biology.\nAbout the role: \nWe are looking for experts in Machine Learning and 3D Graphics, who are passionate about generative models and creative applications of AI. In particular, we are looking for people who share our mission of open-sourcing machine learning models; people who do not believe AI models should be controlled by a centralized gatekeeper behind a closed wall, but rather be truly open and in control by all. You will have access to state-of-the-art high performance computing resources and you will work alongside other creative, hard-working top researchers and engineers, to make a lasting, positive impact in the fast-growing world of generative AI.\nResponsibilities: \nContribute to the creation and improvement of applications and use cases such as text-to-3D, 2D-to-3D, text-to-4D, simple and fast 3D editing\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and make systematic progress towards enabling anyone to easily and quickly create complex, animated and interactive 3D characters and environments\nTake ownership of ML and 3D graphics new and existing features, across the whole product lifecycle, from developing prototypes, to assisting the teams charged with production and maintenance - with minimal supervision\nCollaborate within Stability and in the open-source community on developing the next generation of 3D-aware neural models, where you may assist with areas such as optimization of model training, model tuning, dataset engineering, automation of processes, tooling, data translation, integration in game engines, etc.\nAlways look for opportunities to delight our customers and improve their life through AI\nIf you want: publish new ideas on arxiv and in major conferences\nQualifications: \n3+ years working on state-of-the-art ML or 3D graphics projects (ideally both), including training, fine-tuning ML models, neural graphics, raytracing, etc.\nExperience researching and implementing SOTA algorithms related to ML or 3D, e.g Neural Radiance Fields, real-time 3D graphics, diffusion models, 3D file format conversion, etc.\nExperience with Python scientific stack, PyTorch or similar ML frameworks\nCommunicate ML insights and results effectively: verbally, in writing and through visualization\nSelf-motivated, well-organized (e.g. keep track of your own priorities and refine the plan according to new insights), self-reliant (able to debug complex issues with minimal supervision)\nDesirable but optional:\nML and 3D open-source projects or influential publications\nPerformance optimization, such as profiling shaders and/or ML systems, C++/CUDA, algorithmic improvements, ML quantization and distillation\n3D graphics and game development, e.g. OpenGL, DirectX, Vulkan, Unreal Engine, Unity, Godot\nJAX, TPUs, compiler development\nEqual Employment Opportunity:\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, national origin, gender, sexual orientation, age, veteran status, disability or other legally protected statuses.", "departments": [{"id": 4017298101, "name": "Research", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": null}], "offices": [{"id": 4004731101, "name": "Remote", "location": null, "child_ids": [], "parent_id": null}], "compliance": null, "demographic_questions": null, "questions": [{"description": null, "label": "First Name", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "first_name", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Last Name", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "last_name", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Email", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "email", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Phone", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "phone", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Resume/CV", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "resume", "type": "input_file", "values": []}, {"name": "resume_text", "type": "textarea", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Cover Letter", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "cover_letter", "type": "input_file", "values": []}, {"name": "cover_letter_text", "type": "textarea", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "LinkedIn Profile", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "question_4912516101", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Website", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "question_4912517101", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "What interests you to apply for this role with Stability.ai?", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "question_4912518101", "type": "textarea", "values": []}]}], "location_questions": [], "file": "stabilityai-4194789101.json"}
