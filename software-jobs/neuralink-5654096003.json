Projects include design of test infrastructure to reduce hardware development and manufacturing time, electronics packaging for our charger and implant electronics, and tooling to help interface the implant with the surgical robot.\nJob Responsibilities:\nAs a mechanical engineer intern at Neuralink, you will have the opportunity to design and produce hardware solutions for our brain-machine interface devices, including surgical robotics, automation, microfabrication, and more. You will get to own projects from concept to production, utilizing your mechanical engineering background in the challenging field of brain-machine interfaces. The role involves collaboration with neuroscientists, biologists, and engineers to determine design criteria and build systems quickly and effectively.\nAbout you:\nYou find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.\nYou deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.\nYou are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software, mechanical, electrical, materials, biological engineers, and neuroscientists. You are comfortable communicating across teams.\nResourceful, flexible and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.\nKey qualifications:\nStrong understanding of engineering first principles.\nPreferred qualifications:\n1+ years of mechanical engineering industry experience, including owning products from concept to production.\nExperience with conventional machining and rapid prototyping technologies.\nExperience with precision design and manufacturing.\nExperience with advanced imaging techniques.\nPay Transparency:\nBased on California law, the following details are for California individuals only:California hourly rate:$35/hr USD\nFor full-time employees, your compensation package will include two major components: salary and equity. Guidance on salary for this role will be determined according to the level you enter the organization (with the ability to gain more through time as you contribute). \n \nFull-Time Employees are eligible for equity and benefits listed below in addition.\nWhat we offer:\nAn opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and most talented experts from different fields. \nGrowth potential. We rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact. \nExcellent medical, dental, and vision insurance through a PPO plan; parental leave.\nFlexible time off + paid holidays.\nEquity + 401(k) plan.\nCommuter Benefits.\nMeals provided.\nMultiple studies have found that a higher percentage of women and BIPOC candidates won't apply if they don't meet every listed qualification.
