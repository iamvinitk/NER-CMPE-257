We partner with the best minds and most experienced teams across industry and academia, bringing together the knowledge, experience, and skills required to navigate our critical path.\nMission\nWe want to mine space resources from near-Earth asteroids to provide abundant, sustainable energy and resources in space and for Earth.\nVision \nAsteroid mining has lived at the intersection of scientific research and popular culture for decades, with as many academic papers published as there are books, TV shows and movies about it.\nAccess to resources, with its finite nature and disparate distribution, plays an essential part in the geopolitical web of power and wealth. It has defined economic growth to such an extent that we have been using them as primary demarcation lines and identifiers in our history, from the stone to bronze and iron age to our current silicon age.\nBut our resources-driven growth faces a massive existential challenge, with climate change, ecosystem degradation and resource depletion demanding a complete reset. Humanity needs to shift global transportation, manufacturing, construction and energy onto a sustainable path.\nExpanding beyond the K\u00c3\u00a1rm\u00c3\u00a1n line is where we believe transformative future growth and innovation will be found. Recent missions by NASA (OSIRIS-REx & DART) and JAXA (Hayabusa2) have firmly pushed the idea of using space resources from academic research into commercial opportunity.\nWe believe the Regolith Age, powered by abundant space resources, is an inevitability that we can accelerate.\nWe value these principles:\nDiversity of thought. We believe that different perspectives drive better results. We aim to build diverse teams and a diverse company.\nOwnership, feedback and accountability. Ideas improve through collaboration, discussion and iteration. Decisions don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t follow the same pattern and revert to the mean when made in a group. We aim to have clear ownership, accountability for results and autonomy to deliver. \nNo silos. We build cross-functional teams to be able to deliver on our goals. There are no predefined lanes for people to operate in, information is pushed out across all teams to make sure we benefit from cross-pollination.\nHigh talent bar, no assholes. We optimize for potential and a growth mindset. We value experience, but only when balanced with self-awareness and first principles thinking.\nSmall is beautiful. The best results as well as the best work experience come from a small team of talented people working towards a common goal.\nAbout the role: Senior/Principal Electrical Engineer\nKarman+ is building toward a vision of asteroid mining at scale which includes pioneering techniques for physical sample extraction from an asteroid surface. You will own all electrical architecture designs, pushing for specific testing and integrating components for payload testing. You will lead the effort to outline electrical solutions for driving and observation of the excavation equipment, provide EE solutions for the GNC group to create a sensor suite to observe, approach, and dock with an asteroid, and work with the bus provider for seamless integration for the payload team.\nWe have 3 major systems that will require electrical knowledge, design, or support: The excavation system (ie. motors, sensors, etc), the GNC system (cameras, controller board, CDH for final approach, RCS, etc), and the Prop system (thrusters, tank, thermal, etc).  All of these systems will require boards for control and telemetry, along with the harnesses to route between the subsystems and the bus.\nKey roles and responsibilities:\nDefine, develop, analyze, provide technical oversight of procurement, integrate, and test the electrical power system and related components at all levels of assembly\nPerform electrical systems integration, including design, prototype/lab integration, and flight verification, to ensure all analog electrical aspects of our system will successfully interoperate\nPerform electrical systems analyses such as overcurrent, fusing, wire gauge and connector sizing, transient response, battery capacity, and operational voltage limits\nDefine, procure, and integrate electrical power system components: solar arrays, batteries, battery charging circuitry, power distribution, wire harnesses, and point-of-load components\nDefine grounding architecture, detailed grounding design, and grounding-related processes\nOwn and maintain electrical interface control documents between subsystems, the bus, and components\nReview and guide subsystem and system EMI/EMC testing to tailor it to our mission needs and address any test findings to an outcome aligned with company objectives\nDefine and implement the system level test and verification activities for the electrical power system, including defining and guiding development of the electrical ground support equipment needed for system integration\nLead the resolution of test or operational issues with your hardware, including determining root cause and corrective action\nBring and evaluate new and emerging technology options to advance our approach for better cost, SWAP, or performance\nBasic Qualifications\nYou are authorized to work in the U.S. as a US citizen (or equivalent) and are ITAR compliant\nBS degree or higher in Engineering or a related technical field is required plus at least 5 years of related experience\nBoard layout, schematic, manufacturing, and testing of a board (ie. full life cycle experience)\nExperience as a technical team leader, guiding junior electrical engineers, technicians, and working with multiple other disciplines to ensure system closure\nIndustry-proven expertise in electrical power systems and power systems analysis for space missions\nProficiency with power supply circuit analysis, wire harness sizing analyses, fusing/overcurrent sizing analyses, transient power system analyses, solar array string sizing analyses, battery discharge and voltage relationships, and ensuring system design closure across both cold low voltage and hot high voltage system conditions\nPrevious experience with EMI/EMC testing, the complexities associated with redundant components, derating for space missions, Worst Case Circuit Analysis (WCCA), Electrical Parts Stress Analysis (EPSA), Failure Mode, Effects, and Criticality Analysis (FMECA), launch umbilical interfaces, and using voltage telemetry on lithium ion cells to estimate actual depth-of-discharge in the presence of measurement uncertainties\nSystems engineering mentality (ie. thinking beyond just the electrical or board implications, but how it affects mechanical, thermal, operations, etc)\nStrong communication skills and the ability to effectively pass on and share your knowledge with others\nFlexibility: We are a small-team doing a lot of things - a flexible and positive mindset is instrumental for success!\nA humble and open mind: willingness to accept feedback and consistently improve upon yourself and the product you will be responsible for\nA high-degree of emotional intelligence: ability to collaborate closely with coworkers in a respectful and empathetic manner\nBelief in the value of diversity: active appreciation of each person\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s unique perspective and realization that diversity produces better outcomes\nLearns from their mistakes (ie. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153My board design didn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t work because X, since then I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve changed my approaches like this and have since fixed those flawed designs)\nKarman Plus is an Equal Opportunity/Affirmative Action Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, pregnancy, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, protected veteran status, or disability status.\nWe offer:\nOur cash compensation amount for this role is targeted at $150.000 - $200,000.00 annually in this location.
