We use mostly Scala and TypeScript, among others.\nManagement of large datasets with milliseconds order of magnitude access time, to compute in a near real-time complex auction resolution algorithm (18 million predictions per second).\nBuild efficient and easy-to-use web products used by thousands of users working for the world's most premium publishers, advertisers, and agencies.\nA fast-changing environment where we continuously collaborate with Product teams and constantly adapt our Cloud infrastructure for new features and Products.\nBring a wide diversity of profiles to the same level of quality and knowledge.\n \nOur InApp Team\nThe InApp team aims for Teads to become a competitive player through innovative offerings and a sustainable advertising model for publishers. \nTo achieve this, the team fosters the growth of the InApp ecosystem by empowering App developers with a best-in-class SDK (Software Development Kit) and dedicated tooling, ensuring the effectiveness of Teads-specific offerings for our Advertisers in mobile applications.\n \nWhat will you do?\nAs a Mobile Software Engineer (for the iOS platform), you will also have some specific challenges: \nQuality and robustness as a pillar. Working on a SDK adds inertia between release and app integration. We have developed a robust and well-tested code to limit the bad impact of this inertia.\nHave a good understanding of native applications. Our SDK is a mix between native and TypeScript code (20%-80%) allowing developers to use full native interface but allowing us to share a lot between the iOS & Android SDKs.\nBeing able to adapt our process and our technology to face proprietary store evolution (IDFA less, new store restrictions, new architecture requirement, etc.).\nYour missions will be to:\nDevelop our SDK in native language.\nSupport and contribute to our core engine (in TypeScript).\nDevelop an application to support our SDK (mobile, web, desktop, etc.).\nWork with other members of the engineering team on other products of the platform to sustain our SDK.\n \nWhat will you bring to the team\nGood programming abilities. Testing your development is second nature to you, and you are very mindful about your application architecture, performance and maintainability and its overall quality.\nOpen minded to cross platform development.\nStrong problem solving skills.\nWorking collaboratively with the team, able to explain your decision and share you knowledge.\nA strong knowledge of Swift language and mobile application development (have already participate to app available on App Store is important).\nBonus points:\nKnowledge in back-end development on Java environment.\nKnowledge on React development.\nMySQL or SQL usage in general.\nParticipate and/or animate with the developer community: blog post, conference, meetup, etc.\n \nWhy work at Teads?\nAt Teads, Product and Engineering work hand in hand and are aligned towards the same goal: to scale our business while continuing to create new and exciting products.\nWe value team spirit, pragmatism, listening and we encourage initiatives.\nWe promote end-to-end development: \u201cYou build it, you run it, you monitor it\u201d.\nWe share knowledge and support with each other beyond any organizational boundary.\nWe fix issues during a blameless postmortem and learn from it so that it doesn\u2019t happen twice.\nWe are working together to create great engineering, but we are also supportive to promote a great work-life balance.\n \nWe care about you:\nSecurity & Savings: Attractive package providing financial peace of mind, including competitive compensation, profit-sharing, daily meal vouchers (Swile), family health insurance (Alan), and a personalized relocation package (if needed).\nCareer Development: Continuous investment in our employees' skills: in-house and external training, tech conference opportunities, internal mobility (individual contributor or management career ladder).\nLife Balance: A well-balanced work-life for our employees is one of our top priorities: 35+ days off per year, hybrid work (2-3 days remote work per week, more is open to discussion), fully covered parental leave, and reserved daycare places.\nWellness: Prioritizing employee well-being through premium work equipment, enjoyable work environment (work-life balance, team building events, summits), remote work subsidy, promoting Diversity & Inclusion with internal & external initiatives (women speaking groups, dedicated school partnerships), dedicated charitable time and sustainability actions (Eco Tree, subsidy for eco-mobility).\nDiscover more about our culture and benefits on our Engineering website.\n \nWhat are our recruitment process steps?\n \n \n We want to get to know you and we try to give you the insight you need to make an informed decision to join us.
