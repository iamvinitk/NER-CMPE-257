Our robot, Digit, is the first to be sold into workplaces across the globe. Our team is differentiated by its expertise in imagining, engineering, and delivering robots with advanced mobility, dexterity, intelligence, and efficiency -- robots specifically designed to work alongside people, in spaces built for people. Every day, we break through engineering challenges and invent new solutions and capabilities that will one day make robots commonplace and approachable. This work is our passion and our responsibility: our mission is to make businesses more productive and people\u2019s lives more fulfilling.\n \nResponsibilities:\nThe Test Engineering Manager will report to the Systems Engineering and Integration Director and will be responsible for managing, growing, and inspiring our team of test engineers.\nHe/She will work closely with electrical, mechanical, software, and manufacturing teams to support test definition, development, and execution.\nManage hiring and performance reviews for test engineering group\nOversee the daily workflow, assignments, and work schedules of test engineers, and create and iterate on the processes used to support work management of the team.\nMonitor test team deliverables and project timelines and ensure that team objectives are met.\nPromote and contribute to a safe, collaborative work environment\nMentor and guide the test engineers\n \nAbout the role:\n \nWe are currently designing the next generation of Digit for commercial scale. The scale of the system and reliability that must be achieved are orders of magnitude higher than any existing bipedal platform, including our own, and the primary method that this will be achieved is by rigorous design and substantial testing. The test engineering team owns the processes and support structure around the execution of tests, and therefore will be a primary focal point of the definition and validation of success of the product. The Test Engineering Manager will be responsible for the team and the test processes within Agility.\n \nAbout The Work:\nDevelop and maintain a deep knowledge of all subsystems used in Agility\u2019s products and calibration and test equipment.\nTranslate system requirements and engineering specifications into tests.\nNegotiate test rigor and trade-offs with multiple stakeholders.\nWork with talented cross-functional teams to drive innovative, elegant testing solutions that meet validate requirements.\nManage hiring and performance reviews for test engineering group\nDevelop and maintain test automation infrastructure that supports and exercises Agility\u2019s products at the component and solution levels\n \n \nAbout you:\nMinimum Bachelor\u2019s degree in an engineering discipline\nMinimum 10 or more years of relevant professional experience\nMinimum 5 or more years experience working as an engineering manager\nProven project management skills\nAuthorization to work in the USA\n \nPreferred to have:\nAdvanced degrees with professional engineering experience\nProven project management skills\nSkilled in conflict resolution, contract negotiation\nBroad design experience relevant to robotics: embedded systems, high-speed signals, servo drives, Ethernet/EtherCAT, cameras, Lidar, IMU, CPU/GPU integration, etc.\nBe on site at Agility\u2019s design facility as needed (minimum 2 days per week and as needed to support design activities, reviews, prototype builds, etc.)\nKnowledge of relevant technologies which may include:\nMechatronics / Robotics\nMechanical and electrical interfaces\nCommunication protocols\nSensors, actuators, controllers\nKinematics of mechanisms\nVision and display systems\nUnderstanding of structured product development (requirements-driven engineering, documentation, rigorous verification, etc.)\nEngineering verification test development and execution\nExperience with motors and motor control, especially using BLDC motors\nExperience with sensors such as Encoders, Hall Effect Sensors, Torque, and Load Cells\nExperience with Ethernet, EtherCat, USB, and other high-speed busses\nBenefits \nCompetitive Compensation Package\n100% Company Paid Disability, Life, Health, Dental & Vision Insurance (for AR employees)\nEmployer Matched Retirement Plan\nFive Weeks of Paid Time Off Annually\nPaid Parental Leave\nTuition Reimbursement\nEmployee Referral Bonus Program\nRelocation Assistance (for certain roles)\nStock Options (for certain roles)\nA culture that encourages flexible work schedules\nA culture that embraces individuality and authenticity\nAgility Robotics is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
