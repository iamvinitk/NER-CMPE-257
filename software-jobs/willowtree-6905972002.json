These mission-critical initiatives aren\u2019t solved by a single discipline. Great digital is a team game - it requires seamlessly combining strategy, engineering, design, data science, marketing, and more. Other firms have bolted on these capabilities - as digital natives, we\u2019ve built them into our teams from Day 1. The result? Top and bottom lines that grow, alongside our client\u2019s capabilities. Check out how we have impacted our clients' digital portfolios over the years.\nIn January 2023, WillowTree was acquired by TELUS International (Symbol: TIXT).  The combined company brings an unparalleled ability to deliver seamless, trusted, digitally-enabled experiences across any channel a customer might choose - be it mobile apps, websites, voice skills, chatbots, email, service agents, or associates.\nThe Opportunity\nWe believe the best ideas come from shared creativity. What sets us apart from other agencies is that our engineers sit right beside researchers and creatives, so perspectives from multiple disciplines shape our products. Our summer internship program gives current students the chance to make an impact by contributing ideas and adding a fresh perspective to real client projects. And just to make sure you\u2019re advancing in your craft, you\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to spend time with team members in your discipline to discuss the latest trends in tech or gain insight on a new skill. \nWe understand our responsibility to create a diverse, equitable, and inclusive place within the tech industry, while pushing to make our industry more representative. Because of this responsibility, we need candidates who value diversity and inclusion through their work, team collaboration, or involvement in student organizations. \n*This is a hybrid position. This role is open in three locations: Charlottesville, VA, Columbus, OH, and Durham, NC.\nYour Impact\nYour day-to-day work will influence millions of users\nYou\u2019ll have the opportunity to learn every day from engineering leadership\nHands-on experience by working on real client work\nYou\u2019ll build amazing products people love\nYou\u2019ll participate in the delivery of large and complex software projects in a team-based environment\nYour Background\nYou plan to graduate in Fall/Winter 2024 or later\nHave experience with mobile or web development (Swift, Java, Kotlin, TypeScript, Javascript, etc.)\nYou\u2019ve done a mobile project in school or in your spare time\nA self-starter who embraces new technologies\nYou are intellectually curious and enjoy digging into what makes each platform unique\nA commitment to delivering quality code for best-in-class digital experiences\nYou appreciate good design and have an eye for details\nApplicants must be authorized to work permanently for any employer in the U.S. We are unable to sponsor employment visas at this time.\nP.S. Even if you don\u2019t have expertise in all of the qualifications listed, we value new perspectives and encourage you to apply. We\u2019re committed to building a diverse company that reflects the diversity of our users. If you feel confident about a good amount of the bullet points above, we\u2019ll ramp you up on the rest.\nWhy WillowTree?\nWe offer a place to be yourself.\nOur differences, both visible and invisible, benefit our teams, our communities, and the products we craft. That\u2019s why WillowTree strives to build a team with diverse backgrounds, skills, and perspectives. You\u2019ll work hard here; however, we\u2019ll balance that with a culture that supports your growth and cares about your well-being. We\u2019re committed to creating an environment of inclusion \u2014 a place where every Tree can thrive.\nOur summer internship program is an opportunity for you to work on real client projects and make a real impact on our organization all while receiving one-on-one mentoring from our full-time team members. Not only that, but you\u2019ll have snacks galore, and plenty of chances to socialize with your fellow interns \u2014 including fun outings during work hours. We\u2019ll have you with us full time (think 40 hours a week for 10 weeks) and yes, it is definitely paid. Not a bad gig, right? \nWillowTree celebrates our differences and provides equal employment opportunities to all team members and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, age, sex, national origin, disability status, genetics, protected veteran status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local laws. Diverse teams build better products. We acknowledge that the tech industry especially lacks opportunity for those who are of non-traditional backgrounds and in underrepresented groups.
