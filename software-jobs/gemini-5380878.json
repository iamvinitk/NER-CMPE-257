Gemini offers a wide range of crypto products and services for individuals and institutions in over 70 countries.\nOur flagship product, the Gemini Exchange, was built to be a compliant and secure platform to buy, sell, and store crypto. Our suite of retail products includes ActiveTrader, a high-performance platform for advanced traders. Gemini also offers the Gemini Credit Card providing real-time crypto rewards, the Gemini dollar (GUSD), a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, and Gemini Staking, allowing users to securely stake their tokens on-chain and receive rewards. Nifty Gateway, Gemini's NFT platform, is the world's premier marketplace for NFTs and digital art.\nGemini customers also have access to a wide range of institutional products tailor-made for high-net-worth individuals, asset and wealth managers, and hedge funds and liquidity providers seeking exposure to crypto. Customers looking to place large orders can use Gemini eOTC, a fully-electronic over-the-counter trading platform built for high-value bulk orders. For wealth management professionals, we offer a unique destination for their clients\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 crypto portfolios from a single platform, and we enable fully electronic clearing and settlement of off-exchange crypto trades.\nThe Department: Crypto Core\nThe Role: Staff Software Engineer (Applied Cryptography)\nSecurity of customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 digital assets and personal information held with Gemini is our first and foremost priority. Gemini\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Signing team develops and maintains software for the purpose of working with Gemini customers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 digital assets. To directly support our cryptographic software, hardware, and trusted execution environments, this work includes developing and managing cryptographic security tools and libraries and building new tools to help customers securely interact with various blockchains.\nIn our work, we research and develop approaches in our signing environment. Among other projects, this may include implementing secure multi-party computation, partial homomorphic schemes, and applying zero knowledge proofs. We do this all while using hardware to protect our keys in trusted platform modules (TPMs), hardware security modules (HSMs), and trusted execution environments (TEEs). An ideal candidate would have experience in the implementation of cryptographic software that was used with one or more of these hardware areas (e.g., signing, encrypting, load-time attestation, digital signatures, sealing, binding). This engineer will also work closely with various teams including our Security Operations, Custody, Product Security, Wallet Engineering, and Platform Engineering teams. \nWe are a dynamic group with both entrepreneurial spirit and security engineering experience. We have incredibly high aspirations, and we are looking for like-minded individuals who want to guide the transition to a new more decentralized world where access to digital assets is normalized and ubiquitous.\nResponsibilities:\nMaintain and build the software that is the foundation for our MPC work\nImplement software applications that may include key storage, signing, encryption, code attestation, or secure boot\nDesign, deploy, and maintain security solutions supporting maintenance of digital assets\nWork closely with software security engineers to develop the capabilities of the existing signing security infrastructure with a goal of security and scalability\nDevelop tools that integrate security into systems and process\nParticipate in disaster recovery (DR) scenarios to validate operability of physical and digital material\nWork with hardware security mechanisms of interest including a trusted platform module (TPM) and/or hardware security modules (HSMs), and/or other similar hardware key storage mechanisms\nMinimum Qualifications:\nSoftware development experience in at least one of homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation, security protocols, PAKE protocols, zero knowledge proofs, or pallier encryption\nStrong understanding of encryption and key management\nExperience in systems architecture, computer architecture, trustworthy computing, or cryptographic protocols\nExperience in system algorithms with performance understanding and optimizations (hardware and software)\nExperience integrating or deploying in production environments\nFamiliarity with a modern programming language (e.g., Rust, Python, C++, Scala) and a shell environment\nExperience in researching and addressing complex business topics around TPMs, HSMs, TEEs, secure build infrastructure, and applied cryptography. Candidates without a strong understanding in one of these areas may still be a strong candidate if this is offset by a strong background in a systems security area (e.g., operating systems, embedded systems security, firmware security, network security engineering)\nStrong understanding of systems/network security, secure protocol design, secure build and supply chain management, encryption, authentication, key management and applied cryptography\nDemonstrated ability to convert theoretical security concepts into production\nProficiency in a common scripting language including but not limited to Python, Ruby, etc.\nAble to troubleshoot and debug issues, and demonstrate a methodical approach to root cause analysis\nExperience working with engineering teams, teaching, training, and mentoring on how to implement best-practice technical solutions\nStrong written and verbal communication skills; attentive to details\nPreferred Qualifications:\n4+ years experience in software development with a focus in applied cryptography\n2+ years experience in reading/writing code in Rust, Python, Linux, Scala, C/C++\n2+ years experience with secure software that makes use of a trusted platform module (TPM), hardware security module (HSM), trusted execution environment (TEE), smartcard, and/or other similar hardware key storage mechanism\nSolid understanding of product management and product ownership, software development practices (e.g., SDLC), and methodologies\nKnowledge of hardware security, verified/secure boot, tamper resistance, side-channel attacks, anti-cloning, and PUFs\nHaving prior knowledge in the blockchain space is not a requirement but good to have\nIt Pays to Work Here\n \nThe compensation & benefits package for this role includes:\nCompetitive base salary\nBenefits\nDiscretionary annual bonus\nAt Gemini, we strive to build diverse teams that reflect the people we want to empower through our products, and we are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity, or Veteran status.
