We build software to automate the carbon footprinting of supply chains. Banks, traders, and manufacturers use our product to tame the complexity of international supply networks, identify the most carbon-intensive parts, and find greener alternatives.\nTo join CarbonChain, you\u2019ll be a keen technologist who loves to learn from others. Our company is made up of 10 passionate people with expertise ranging from oil refining to deep learning. Between us we\u2019ve run Amazon\u2019s European supply chain, built JustEat\u2019s corporate meal delivery platform, and monitored industrial emissions with satellites for Al Gore. We\u2019ve got MBAs and PhDs but we know that there\u2019s a lot we don\u2019t know, and we\u2019re hoping you can help fill that gap.\nWorking at CarbonChain\nWe encourage every member of our team to be the best they can be, whether that\u2019s developing skills through their learning budget or participating in reading groups. Our work requires everybody to straddle the physical and digital worlds, and a growth mindset is essential. One week you might become an expert in the production of copper and figure out how to represent copper electrorefining in Java, whilst the next might be spent modelling the emissions of container ships and visualizing how they compare to LNG tankers in D3.js.\nOur software has to be clever to represent the insane complexity of real-world supply chains, but clever software is worthless if nobody wants to use it. We\u2019re focused on building intuitive software which minimizes cognitive load. If people love our tools, they\u2019ll use them to make the changes the planet needs.\nWhat will you be responsible for at Carbon Chain?\nWe are at the start of our journey and want to build the right things, the right way. We are cloud-first, allowing us to scale at will and experiment with adding new services quickly. As a Senior Data Engineer you\u2019ll play a key role within the company, taking responsibility for our core data infrastructure and its evolution to support the company\u2019s growth. You will lead the design, implementation, and maintenance of a performant and cost efficient data pipelines, as well as contribute to the overall CarbonChain data architecture, with the goal of expanding our data capabilities - feature development, analytics, and ML. You will work closely with cross-functional teams to ensure the delivery of high-quality data sets and features, that empower our key business and product decision makings, and enable CarbonChain\u2019s growth and customer success.\nYou can expect to have:\nOwnership of your projects\nAn independent path to production\nThe ability to make real changes with tangible business value\nThe core of the system relies on a Python application, but we aren\u2019t shy to add other tools that make us ship valuable features better and faster. Other tools comprise Java (Spring Boot), Angular/Typescript, PostgreSQL, Redis, Neo4j, Google Identity, but our cloud-based infrastructure enables us to explore new technologies parallel with our existing platform. We\u2019d love to bring on engineers who come from diverse backgrounds to help us explore new angles of solving business challenges and deliver solutions that wow our customers.\nWhich tools, technologies, and processes will you work with?\nContainerised applications are the key to our technology vision allowing us to replicate production environments locally and scale services at will.\nObject-oriented code forms the bulk of our codebase.\nPostgreSQL, Neo4j and DynamoDB form the persistence layer - you\u2019ll learn to navigate relational, graph, and document databases and appreciate their respective values.\nInfrastructure automation is owned by the whole team, helping to spread the DevOps mindset across the whole tech department (and beyond!).\nTesting approaches from unit testing to integration testing are key to delivering reliable and maintainable solutions.\nQuality assurance is owned by the team themselves - we believe that the ownership of the full development cycle should sit tightly within the team.\nAgile development, using various approaches from Scrum to Elephant Carpaccio, helps us deliver software in small iterations, learning and course-correcting in the process to make sure that what we deliver has an impact.\nGitHub PRs are an integral part of our core development flow - with reviews to improve quality and share knowledge.\nContinuous delivery is the approach we strive for - with metrics that help us optimise parts of the pipeline that need it the most.\nTeamwork and collaboration are fundamental to the delivery of our solutions. We encourage solutionizing between tech and the wider business.\nWhat we require from applicants\nRight to work in the UK and willingness to come to London office 2+ days a week\nA passion for environmental issues\nMinimum of 7 years of experience in data engineering or relevant backend development, with a proven track record of building highly scalable, performant, and reliable data pipelines\nExtensive experience with data modelling for large distributed data warehouses and/or lakehouses (or a similar cloud based) solutions, you\u2019re able to discuss in-depth general principles and trade-offs of different modelling approaches\nExperience in working with \u201cmodern data stack\u201d standard data frameworks and adjacent tools \u2013 such as Fivetran, Airbyte, BigQuery, Databricks, Snowflake, Apache Spark, Kafka, Airflow, Kubernetes, dbt, etc.\nExcellent collaboration and communication skills, with a demonstrated ability to work effectively with cross-functional partners, especially with teams outside of the product and engineering group\nWorking proficiency in one of the programming languages (Python, Go, Scala etc.)\nProduct mindset to embrace business needs and produce scalable data/engineering solutions\nExperience leading technical design discussions and providing guidance on best practices, coding standards, and architecture principles\nThe grit and energy to work in an early stage startup\nWhat we\u2019re offering\nCompetitive salary + generous equity package\nFlexible working hours - we encourage regular breaks and being AFK (away from keyboard) to support your wellbeing\nFlexible working location (we like to meet in the office couple of times every week)\n\u00a31000 annual development allowance for you to spend on developing your current skills and learning new things\nTech equipment of your choice\nRegular social activities\nGenerous amount of holidays\nWe're striving to build a diverse team and we would love to hear from applicants from backgrounds less frequently represented in technology, be that in terms of gender, race, or professional background.\nIf you think your skills and experience match what we\u2019re looking for and you\u2019d like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!If you think your skills and experience match what we\u2019re looking for and you\u2019d like to join a Carbon Tech industry unicorn, please get in touch!\n ", "departments": [{"id": 4004685004, "name": "Product", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": null}], "offices": [{"id": 4036592004, "name": "New York Office", "location": "New York, New York, United States", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": null}], "compliance": null, "demographic_questions": null, "questions": [{"description": null, "label": "First Name", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "first_name", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Last Name", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "last_name", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Email", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "email", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Phone", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "phone", "type": "input_text", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Resume/CV", "required": true, "fields": [{"name": "resume", "type": "input_file", "values": []}, {"name": "resume_text", "type": "textarea", "values": []}]}, {"description": null, "label": "Cover Letter", "required": false, "fields": [{"name": "cover_letter", "type": "input_file", "values": []}, {"name": "cover_letter_text", "type": "textarea", "values": []}]}, {"description": "<p>Throughout the interview process we are looking to collect recent examples of when you have demonstrated our company values.
