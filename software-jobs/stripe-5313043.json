Millions of companies\u2014from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups\u2014use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone\u2019s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nLarge User Onboarding builds the UIs and backend systems to onboard Stripe\u2019s largest users. That includes gathering compliance and risk information, configuring accounts, and generally making sure that account setup is a fast and delightful experience. The optimal onboarding experience for our largest users is very different from the optimal experience for startups and SMBs, and it\u2019s this team\u2019s job to define and build the experience that sets the bar for onboarding the world\u2019s biggest companies.\nWhat you\u2019ll do\nMuch of what Large User Onboarding does is zero-to-one work, not the work of growing and maintaining an already-mature system. So you\u2019ll be an early, pivotal member of the team building the new flows that define large users\u2019 first experience with Stripe\u2019s products. The shape of those flows is not predetermined. You\u2019ll play an active role in shaping them by continuously talking to users and to Sales team members, and then using that detailed knowledge to polish every corner of the user experience.\nResponsibilities\nBuild end-to-end onboarding experiences tailored to Stripe's largest customers like Amazon and Ford.\nWork closely with designers, UX researchers, product managers, members of Stripe\u2019s Sales and Ops teams.\nTalk to Stripe's largest users, deeply understand their experience, and use your expertise to make your projects surprisingly great.\nWho you are\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\nMinimum requirements\n2+ years of experience building delightful user-facing products\nExperience leading your work all the way from scoping through launch. \nComfort moving forward under uncertainty and iterating as you go. You will exercise a lot of ownership and will routinely make important, user-facing decisions about your product.\nStrong written and verbal communication skills, especially in explaining an open question and laying out the path forward.\nYou work unusually quickly.\nPreferred qualifications\nThis role is 70% backend, 30% frontend. Enthusiasm about UI work is required, but experience in it is not as long as you\u2019re willing to learn\nYou\u2019ve started your own company (including side businesses) or worked in the very early stages of a high-growth startup\n", "departments": [{"id": 78914, "name": "8216 Onboarding - Eng", "child_ids": [], "parent_id": 87390}], "offices": [{"id": 65234, "name": "US", "location": null,
