Millions of companies - from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups - use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone's reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nWPP is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe's public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe\u2019s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.\nTogether we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe\u2019s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.\n \nWhat you\u2019ll do\nAs a Design Engineer you will have the breadth to design, concept, prototype, and build new experiences for our web presence. You\u2019ll bring your creativity and expertise to the full range of the Stripe brand, across evergreen pages as well as time-based campaigns. You\u2019ll both utilize and contribute to our libraries and design systems, and when appropriate work outside established systems to create new digital moments.  You\u2019ll constantly have in-browser performance in mind, and create abstractions that other designers and engineers consume and build upon.\nAll Design Engineers in WPP have a shared commitment to user experience and craft, but each pod has subtly different focus areas. The Storytelling pod leverages design, animation, and interaction to explain Stripe and educate our users across the primary Stripe.com surfaces. The Moments pod focuses on creating events and reinforcing brand moments outside of the core Stripe.com identity, with ownership including Stripe Sessions, Stripe Press, and Link.\nResponsibilities\nCollaborate with our team\u2019s designers to prototype and implement web animations and interaction-heavy sites and experiences\nWork closely with other design engineers, pairing, mentoring, and continually building a culture of excellence\nDesign and build entire web experiences, including campaigns, event promotions, standalone microsites, and sections of our core sites\nConcept and prototype UX components and motion studies\nComfortably operate within established design systems as well as creating new experiences outside of systems\nBuild high-performance web pages\n \nWho you are\nWe're looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
