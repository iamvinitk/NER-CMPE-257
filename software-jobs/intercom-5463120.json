Customer service teams from more than 25,000 global organizations, including Atlassian, Amazon and Microsoft, use Intercom to send over 600 million messages per month and enable interactions with over 800 million monthly active end users. The company was founded in 2011 and is backed by leading venture capitalist including Bessemer Venture Partners, Kleiner Perkins and Social Capital. We live by our six company values everyday: Success First, Customer Obsessed, Incredibly High Standards, Open Mindedness, Resilience, Impatience, and Positive & Optimistic. They are stitched into the way we work, interact with others, and hold ourselves accountable. We\u2019re eager to hire individuals who are passionate about our mission, deeply aligned with our values, and are excited to help shape the future of customer service.\nWhat's the opportunity? \ud83e\udd14\nWe're looking for a support engineer to join our team in Chicago, someone with a bit of engineering or web development experience and a desire to be a part of creating truly exceptional customer experiences. If this sounds like you then the Customer Support team at Intercom might be the place for you.\nThis is a very hands-on, technical role, that is much broader than a typical ticket-based support position. Our Support Engineers partner with our customers to tackle the challenging technical issues they face in innovative ways. In this role, you will be directly responsible for helping people integrate Intercom into their products, diagnose and report problems they have, and serve as the bridge between our customers and our product teams. \nWe use Intercom to support Intercom customers, so whether you\u2019re just starting out in your career or want to get a deeper understanding of fundamental customer motivations and how those are applied to building an ambitious, world-class product, this role provides that great opportunity. We have all experienced terrible customer service. Robotic agents running through a script of predetermined messages, never helping or sympathizing, just programmatically following instructions. That\u2019s the opposite of who we are.\nOur way of providing support is based on the principles of continuity and trust and our style of communication is personal, friendly and fun. We engage in dynamic conversations with our customers and are big fans of visual communication (think emojis, stickers, GIFs) - we believe that visual support is human support! We work primarily via the Intercom Messenger, but sometimes jump on calls if it's the right thing to do or the fastest path to resolution.\nThis opportunity is for folks who truly love problem-solving and troubleshooting, with the end goal of empowering our customers\u2019 to reach their objectives and address any challenges with our product. This is not a springboard into other areas or jobs at Intercom, but this is a great role for those who are looking to be part of our support team for a while and who are excited about growing alongside Intercom. We also want people that have an eye for improvement and efficiency, someone who wants to work at a place where they\u2019re encouraged  to bring ideas and feedback to the table on how things could be better for our team and/or our customers.\nWhat will I be doing? \ud83d\ude80\nDebug complex issues with an understanding of both our own codebase and the many technologies employed by our customers\nSolve technical problems for customers on a daily basis\nUtilize inherited and learned technical knowledge to build tools that will help increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the team and its processes\nInfluence the direction of the Intercom product through daily communication with our customers and consistent collaboration with our product teams\nWhat your first 6 months will look like:\n30 days - Onboarding to Intercom & Customer Support: You\u2019ll learn what it means to be an Intercomrade and the ins & outs of our product.
