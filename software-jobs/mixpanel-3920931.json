When everyone in the organization can see and learn from the impact of their work on product, marketing, and company revenue metrics, they are poised to make better decisions.\nOver 8,000 customers, including companies like Netflix, Pinterest, Sweetgreen, Samsara, and Uber, use Mixpanel to understand their customers and measure progress. Our commitment is to provide the most comprehensive and reliable analytics platform accessible and trusted by all.We are actively recruiting for multiple Software Engineers across different levels for our org! \nAbout The Role\nMixpanel engineering is a small team that works quickly, prioritizing getting value to customers and iterating to make those experiences even better. We offer the most powerful product analytics tool while still focusing on making the user experience delightful. The full stack engineers have the freedom to move about the stack to deliver value to customers without being blocked by ownership silos. This means doing everything from building snappy UIs and fast and reliable services to leveraging our powerful query engine to get the customers answers that help them deliver great products. We are looking for folks who seek to understand and own customer problems, participating in every step of the development life cycle from ideation to delivery and maintenance. We encourage ownership and autonomy\u2014if you see customer pain points, you will be empowered to fix them. There is no \"not my problem\" at Mixpanel. All customer problems are ours to fix. We believe that our UX is a key differentiator, and we invest heavily in UI, aiming for a snappy and intuitive experience. We believe in Product-Led Growth, that even enterprise adoption of software tools starts with individual users and the way to get there is through creating a user experience that gets customers to answers quickly.\nResponsibilities\nAt Mixpanel Engineering, Product, and Design (EPD) work closely in pods to define the product and experiences. You'll be collaborating closely with your EPD team to create a vision for delightful and intuitive UX, then work to deliver the most impactful features for our customers. You'll be owning key pieces of the product, maintaining them, and always advocating for improvements to make the user experience even better, adding to our growing shared components library and expanding our design system. You\u2019ll be working on our web app, which is built in Python, running Django, with an open source JavaScript framework running the front end. Everything is run on Google Cloud Platform, using Kubernetes and Docker for orchestration and containerization of our services.\nA typical project requires working across our stack, creating endpoints for your feature as well as developing and deploying the UI. Here are some projects we've worked on in the past to give you an idea of what to expect.\nA way for customers to share their metrics publicly, a pain point for customers who want to easily share their data on social media or with executive leadership. This feature required keeping an eye on security so unintentional data would not be leaked for customers, but would enable easier collaboration.\nWe rebuilt our Live View from the ground up and rebranded to Events. Our goal was to improve users\u2019 trust and make debugging their data and query results easier. With these goals in mind, we removed a number of limitations from Live View, improved key work flows, and tightened the UX. We also drastically simplified both the back-end and front-end architecture resulting in a more performant and maintainable product. The end result is a more powerful tool for our users and a simpler codebase for our developers.\nWe revamped our dashboards UI to improve the workflow for creating and saving analyses that also had the nice side effect of making our data model clearer. This required us to iterate and polish while learning more about how customers used and worked around our product in their day to day. We applied these learnings to smooth our workflows even more while continuing to set the stage for more series of improvements.\nWe redesigned our query builder to allow users to instantly see the results of their changes on one screen. This was required balancing competing requirements of visual space for the query builder and the ability to see two things at once, resulting in a more intuitive UX.\nWe made segmentation faster allowing users to customize what they can compare at the query time vs deciding everything they will ever need at the time they develop your product.\nWhat we're looking for\nWe are hiring full stack engineers at all levels across all teams.\nYou take ownership of problems with a focus on delivering value to users/customers.\nYou can deliver solutions that are pragmatic in approach.\nYou have experience with web application architecture and principles.\nFor more senior roles: You have a proven track record of launching and maintaining large-scale web products.\nAdditional Resources \nEngineering Life Page \nMixpanel Engineering Blog \nCompensation\nThe total target cash compensation (TTCC) for this full-time position would fall within the bands below.
