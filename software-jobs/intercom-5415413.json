The Messenger team is staffed with iOS, Android and full-stack web engineers as well as a Designer and Product manager. We own problems end to end, which means you will work with all those people as we build new products.

We are open to change, adopting the right tools for the job but we are pragmatic in how we use our time. We optimize for delivering the highest value for our customers.\nThe Messenger team collaborates with the other teams in Intercom as we bring a range of features to the mobile SDKs. As platform experts, we know what\u2019s best on mobile and can help support and upskill other teams to adopt their features for mobile.\nWe value moving fast and shipping to learn at Intercom. We\u2019ve got a great CI setup with extensive unit test coverage using XCTestCase and Kiwi. UI tests are done using Calabash. Our strong test coverage allows us to safely move fast without breaking existing features.
