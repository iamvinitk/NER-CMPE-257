Millions of companies\u2014from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups\u2014use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone\u2019s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nThe Support Experience engineering organization builds and improves Stripe\u2019s user support from end to end: how users get help within our products, how they get in touch with us when they have questions, and how our teams use internal tools to answer those questions. We\u2019re accountable for the quality and reliability of this support stack and we use data and firsthand user research to continuously improve it. \nProviding great support to users of all sizes is culturally important to everyone at Stripe. We are a group of capable, friendly, user-oriented engineers that partner closely on this problem with Stripe\u2019s world-class design, product, and operational teams.

For example, we used React to build a chat UI from the ground up so that it would feel at home in the Stripe Dashboard. \nScaling the contact platform that connects Stripe users with the teams that are best equipped to help them. This might involve implementing new API endpoints for use across multiple products, iterating on data pipelines to maximize visibility into our support operations, or adding to our billing pipeline so that we can offer paid support plans in new regions. \nImproving the internal tools that empower our user-facing teams to build new case-solving workflows, publish dynamic, localized content to our user-facing support site, and answer every support request with the right context for any user.\nResponsibilities\nHire, lead, and manage a team of talented engineers on the team, providing mentorship, guidance, and support to ensure their success.\nCollaborate with cross-functional stakeholders, including product managers and designers, to understand customer needs and translate them into technical solutions.\nDefine the technical vision and roadmap for the suite of products managed by the team, aligning it with business objectives and industry best practices.\nDrive the execution of projects, overseeing the entire development lifecycle from planning to delivery, while maintaining high standards of quality and timely completion.\nFoster a collaborative and inclusive work environment, promoting innovation, knowledge sharing, and continuous improvement within the team.\nStay up-to-date with emerging technologies, industry trends, and advancements in observability practices to identify opportunities for improvement and innovation.\nCommunicate effectively with stakeholders, providing regular updates on project status, progress, and any potential risks or challenges.\nWho you are\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
