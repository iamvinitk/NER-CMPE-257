Millions of companies\u2014from the world\u2019s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups\u2014use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone\u2019s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nWe believe that accepting payments and building checkout experiences in mobile apps could be much easier. We\u2019ve solved part of the problem today with our Mobile Payment Element and other products in our SDKs, but our ambition is to go much further. For businesses, it\u2019s still too hard to collect payments in every language, currency, payment method, and tax system, all while customizing the UI to fit their apps.\nMobile is an area of important investment for Stripe, and our mobile SDKs already power an incredible diversity of experiences for companies like DoorDash, Instacart, GOAT, and Kickstarter. We\u2019re looking for an engineer with a solid understanding of the Android platform to help define Stripe\u2019s future on mobile.\nThe team is remote-first. While we do have offices throughout North America, most of the team is distributed throughout the US and Canada and gets together in-person roughly quarterly.\nWhat you\u2019ll do\nAs part of the Mobile Payments team, you\u2019ll develop new payment APIs and checkout UI flows for Android developers to include in their apps. One project could have you implementing a new local payment method to be made available for millions of customers, and the next could have you working to make our checkout experiences more customizable for some of your favorite apps. You\u2019ll also help us continue to explore new technologies like Jetpack Compose and coroutines as we iterate on better solutions for our users.\nResponsibilities\nDesign, build, and maintain the Stripe Android SDK\nWork with engineers, product managers, designers, and stakeholders across the company to bring new features and products to Stripe\u2019s mobile SDKs\nStay up-to-date with the latest industry trends and advancements in Android development and incorporate them into the SDK when appropriate\nCollaborate with Android developers who work on the Stripe mobile apps and Stripe Terminal to set best practices for Android development across the company\nCollaborate effectively in a remote-first work environment, maintaining open communication and strong connections with colleagues\nWho you are\nWe\u2019re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.
