To achieve this goal, we believe the data warehouse architecture as we know it today will be replaced by a new architectural pattern, Lakehouse (CIDR 2021 paper), open platforms that unify data warehousing and advanced analytics. This new architecture will help address several major challenges, including data staleness, reliability, total cost of ownership, data lock-in, and limited use-case support.\nTo achieve this vision, Databricks is building the next generation (decoupled) query engine and structured storage system that can outperform specialized data warehouses in relational query performance. Yet we will retain the expressiveness and robustness of general purpose systems such as Spark to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science. You will be part of this multi-year journey.\nAs part of this team, you will design these next-generation systems that leapfrog state-of-the-art within the following areas:\nQuery compilation and optimization\nDistributed query execution and scheduling\nVectorized execution engine\nData security\nResource management\nTransaction coordination\nEfficient storage structures (encodings, indexes)\nAutomatic physical data optimization\nThe responsibilities you will have:\nDrive requirements clarity and design decisions for ambiguous problems\nProduce technical design documents and project plans\nDevelop new features\nMentor more junior engineers\nTest and rollout to production, monitoring.\nWhat we look for:\nA passion for database systems, storage systems, distributed systems, language design, or performance optimization\nAre comfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables\nBe customer-oriented and focused on having an impact\n5+ years of experience working in a related system\nOptional: PhD in databases or distributed systems\nBenefits\nEmployer contributions to public or private health plan\nEquity awards\nGym reimbursement\nAnnual personal development fund\nWork headphones reimbursement\nBusiness travel insurance\nPaid Parental Leave\nMental wellness resources\nAbout Databricks\nDatabricks is the data and AI company.
