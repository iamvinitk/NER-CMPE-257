We do this by building and running the world's best data and AI infrastructure platform, so our customers can focus on the high value challenges that are central to their own missions.\nFounded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark, Databricks has grown from a tiny corner office in Berkeley, California to a global organization with over 1000 employees. Thousands of organizations, from small to Fortune 100, trust Databricks with their mission-critical workloads, making us one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in the world.\nOur engineering teams build highly technical products that fulfill real, important needs in the world. We constantly push the boundaries of data and AI technology, while simultaneously operating with the resilience, security and scale that is critical to making customers successful on our platform.\nWe develop and operate one of the largest scale software platforms. The fleet consists of millions of virtual machines, generating terabytes of logs and processing exabytes of data per day. At our scale, we regularly observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.\nModern data analysis employs sophisticated methods such as machine learning that go well beyond the roll-up and drill-down capabilities of traditional SQL query engines. As a software engineer on the Runtime team at Databricks, you will be building the next generation distributed data storage and processing systems that can outperform specialized SQL query engines in relational query performance, yet provide the expressiveness and programming abstractions to support diverse workloads ranging from ETL to data science.\nBelow are some example projects:\nData Plane Storage: Deliver reliable and high performance services and client libraries for storing and accessing humongous amount of data on cloud storage backends, e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Store.\nDelta Pipelines: It's difficult to manage even a single data engineering pipeline. The goal of the Delta Pipelines project is to make it simple and possible to orchestrate and operate tens of thousands of data pipelines. It provides a higher level abstraction for expressing data pipelines and enables customers to deploy, test & upgrade pipelines and eliminate operational burdens for managing and building high quality data pipelines.\nPerformance Engineering: Build the next generation query optimizer and execution engine that's fast, tuning free, scalable, and robust.\nWhat we look for:\nBS in Computer Science, related technical field or equivalent practical experience\nOptional: MS or PhD in databases, distributed systems\nComfortable working towards a multi-year vision with incremental deliverables\nMotivated by delivering customer value and impact\n5+ years of production level experience in either Java, Scala or C++\nStrong foundation in algorithms and data structures and their real-world use cases\nExperience with distributed systems, databases, and big data systems (Spark, Hadoop)\nBenefits\nHealth insurance reimbursement and collective healthcare scheme\nLife, accident and disability coverage\nCompany pension\nPaid parental leave\nAnnual vacation bonus\nEquity awards\nGym reimbursement\nAnnual personal development fund\nWork headphones reimbursement\nBusiness travel accident insurance\nAbout Databricks\nDatabricks is the data and AI company.
