At Lyft, our mission is to improve peoples lives with the worlds best transportation. To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.
The Networking team is responsible for all edge and service-to-service network traffic dedicated to making the best ride possible, from our mobile app to our internal microservice architecture. This means providing the most reliable network seamlessly so that our engineers can build platforms that scale. This also means providing tooling to either make the network easy to understand or abstract the network completely.
As an infrastructure engineer in the Networking team, you will build creative engineering solutions to operational problems. You will help operate one of the largest Envoy-based service meshes in the industry, which gives you and the team the opportunity to regularly talk about our work in the community and at conferences, including EnvoyCon, KubeCon, Google Next and re:Invent. Our team regularly gives back to the service mesh community by developing new components and providing patches to the upstream Envoy project.

Build and deploy open-source Envoy with Lyft private extensions to the entire fleet, and create systems to make that process faster, iterative, and reliable
