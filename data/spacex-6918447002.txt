SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
PROPULSION ENGINEER, MACHINING (RAPTOR)
As a propulsion engineer for Raptor machining, you will have the opportunity to influence, scale and solve challenging problems relating to the production of raptor parts and processing. The ideal candidate will thrive in a fast-paced environment with ever changing scope and focus areas. This individual understands how to best design for manufacturing and will conceptualize  implement full scale production processes for machining our critical hardware within production rate and cost goals.
RESPONSIBILITIES:

Identify, develop and implement machining processes to help solve for engine cost, quality and production rate  specifically focused on valve, turbopump, thrust chamber, or injector hardware
Work between manufacturing and design engineers, machinists, technicians, and quality personnel to ensure processes are robust and any production problems are quickly solved
Partner with design to identify and implement design for manufacturing (DFM) updates at both the piece part and system level
Implement machining process controls that allow parts to run lights out. Leverage latest technologies and programming strategies to reduce in-cycle intervention.
Take responsibility for partpart family quality - Expected to understand quality landscape and drive projects to ensure dimensions meet part requirements with low overhead
Drive machining processes toward statistically controlled (SPC) environment. Develop and implement tools needed to show capability
Responsible for full circle machining process from fixture design and manufacturing, CAM programming and program refinement, cutting tool selection and buyoff  inspection methodologies
Regularly challenge each process, part, operation to create the most manufacturable, reliable engine hardware possible
Work with production to ensure hardware you are responsible for is delivered on time or ahead of schedule
Oversee introduction and implementation of new products and products revisions, frequently multiple at a given time
