SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.PCB TECHNICIAN (STARLINK)SpaceX is developing a low latency, broadband internet system to meet the needs of consumers across the globe. Enabled by a constellation of low Earth orbit satellites, Starlink will provide fast, reliable internet to populations with little or no connectivity, including those in rural communities and places where existing services are too expensive or unreliable. We are looking for talented, creative, and driven technicians to drive manufacturing output and yield.  You will have ownership of one or more process areas and will have the opportunity to directly impact Starlinks products.  You will have frequent interaction with engineering teams and leadership and will participate in developing and validating new equipment, processes, and technologies. The success of Starlink depends on the quality, reliability, cost, manufacturability, throughput, security, and user experience of the products that you will manufacture.As a PCB manufacturing technician, you will be working in the many processes within printed circuit board manufacturing in the Starlink factory. This is a versatile and highly skilled, hands on manufacturing job that may include operating production equipment, performing quality inspections, performing chemical analysis and additions, and chemical material handling while meeting goals for output and quality.
