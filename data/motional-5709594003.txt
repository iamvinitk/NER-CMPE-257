Mission Summary
The AV Test Operations Managers create best practices and protocols for vehicle operators to abide by with assistance from the AV Test Supervisors. They are the second point of contact for vehicle operators when issues arise if they cannot be resolved by the Supervisors first or require a Managers input. After coordinating with multiple departments, such as engineering, LD, PMO, and safety, Operations Managers determine what resources are necessary to conduct operations efficiently. They manage and approve time-off requests for team members while ensuring there is no impact on operations. They supervise the daily performance of Supervisors, including coaching, addressing issues, and disciplining in alignment with company policies and standards. They will conduct bi-weekly one on ones with Supervisors and bi-annual and annual performance reviews to ensure effective coaching is in place for Supervisors growth and development.
