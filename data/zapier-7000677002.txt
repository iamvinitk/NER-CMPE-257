About You
You have 7 years of experience. Youve dedicated at least 4 of those years to crafting and refining web-based software products. Your primary domain is the backend, where your expertise is most evident.
Required Technical SkillsExperience:

Strong expertise in using Typescript and Next.js for building web applications and server-rendered pages.
Experience with tRPC for building strongly-typed, type-safe APIs.
Proficiency in working with Prisma ORM for database interactions, particularly when paired with PostgreSQL.
Experience with deploying applications to Vercel.
Using tools like Datadog for monitoring and performance optimization, and to identify and address performance bottlenecks.

Nice-to-Have Technical SkillsExperience:

Knowledge of CICD pipelines and infrastructure as code (e.g., using a tool like GitLab and Terraform).
Skills in database performance optimization and query tuning for PostgreSQL.
Proficiency in implementing and securing authentication and authorization mechanisms, such as OAuth, JWT, role-based access control (RBAC), and session management.
Knowledge or experience with NLP providers like OpenAI or other relevant NLP tools and libraries.

You have a strong systems oriented mindset. You know how to design systems in a distributed manner across hundreds (and even thousands) of servers, and understand how interdependencies affect what you build.  Zapier handles 100s of millions of API calls every week and is growing fast.
You live by the always ship new code mantra. You take immense pleasure in releasing code frequently, knowing that every deployment brings with it enhancements, new features, or solutions that directly impact users. This drive to constantly ship isnt just about quantity for you; its rooted in your belief that iterative improvement, driven by real-world feedback, is the key to creating truly outstanding software. Youre always on the lookout for opportunities to refine, innovate, and deliver, ensuring that users continually benefit from your relentless dedication to progress.
You value collaboration. You understand that building modern software is a team sport, and you enjoy working as part of a tight-knit team. Youre happy to pitch in and help the team, whether by reviewing code, pairing on a tricky problem, or just thinking about how to solve the challenges were facing.
Youre driven by results, not by process. In the ever-changing landscape of software development, you recognize that while processes are essential, they should never overshadow the end goal: delivering exceptional value. Your modus operandi involves light yet effective process and technical planning. You are adept at navigating through challenges with agility, ensuring that the emphasis remains on outcomes rather than getting entangled in procedures.
You care about the why more than the what. Your approach to engineering isnt just about ticking boxes or following directives. You deeply value clarity and purpose in your work. If priorities seem nebulous or not optimized, youre confident and proactive in seeking clarity, ensuring that the teams efforts align with the broader vision. Misalignments dont escape your keen eye, and youre quick to flag them, ensuring that the team remains on a coherent and impactful trajectory.
Youre intentional and articulate. Every design choice you make, every line of code you write, stems from a place of intentionality. Youre not one to follow the herd blindly. Instead, you advocate robustly for your design choices and implementation strategies. Actively seeking feedback is second nature to you, and you thrive in environments where technical discussions are encouraged. When faced with roadblocks, youre not one to merely raise the flag. Youre proactive in identifying those who can provide solutions or even devising alternative approaches. Your approach to engineering isnt dogmatic; youre flexible, adaptable, and always prepared to explain the rationale behind your decisions.
You embody the lets make it work ethos. Challenges, whether monumental or minuscule, dont deter you. You dive in with a can-do attitude, unfazed by the magnitude or nature of the task. You understand that in the broader scheme of things, not every task will be about building the next flashy feature. Sometimes, its about fortifying the foundations, ensuring that the system is robust and resilient. Youre discerning enough to know when to invest time in hardening the system versus when to prioritize speed. In essence, youre a true team player, understanding that every task, no matter how glamorous or mundane, plays a pivotal role in the teams collective success.
You can balance lots of concerns. Backend apps have to take into account performance (using networks and devices that we cant control), customer demands, AB tests, UX research, accessibility, code quality, a rapidly changing ecosystem of languages and modules, and the list goes on. We actually want to ship things too! You can balance those demands without getting overwhelmed and keep the needle moving forward.
You advocate for the user. Your commitment to the end user is unwavering. With a keen eye for design and deep-rooted empathy, any indication of user challenges becomes a personal mission for you. This drive pushes you to delve deeper, understand the core issues, and guide your team towards enhancing the product experience.
Youre an avid learner. The tech worlds constant evolution excites you. Always on the prowl for the next big thing, youre quick to immerse yourself in the intricacies of its implementation. While TypeScript and React are your fortresses, youre not one to shy away from challenges, whether they come in the form of Python, CSS, build tools, or shell scripts. If its uncharted territory, youre gearing up to master it.
Your prowess in backend AI chatbot development is unmistakable. With extensive experience in spearheading technically intricate and demanding cross-functional projects, you stand out as a seasoned backend engineer. Your proficiency isnt just limited to mere technologies; it extends to deep knowledge of LangChain, OpenAI, especially in leveraging plugins, and your interest or expertise in workflow systems like the Runner team further elevates your profile. Your adeptness in integrating with external APIs, consuming OpenAPI specifications, and designing resilient failure handling mechanisms showcases your holistic approach. You possess a keen understanding of creating efficient, durable, and scalable data models, ensuring the backend systems you design stand the test of time and load.
You value our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we work together and how we think about our customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust and ensure we work and collaborate together to democratize automation. You see how these values can empower meaningful work, you thrive in a collaborative setting, you are eager to continue growing and youre excited to be part of the team.
