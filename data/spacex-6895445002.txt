SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.INTEGRATION  TEST ENGINEER (DRAGON)Integration and Test engineers are responsible for understanding every system on the Dragon 2 spacecraft and how they are interconnected. Engineers on this team must have working knowledge of overall vehicle design, schematics, operations, manufacturing, testing, and flight. A successful Integration and Test engineer demonstrates engineering intuition and critical thinking, and is comfortable working under ambiguous or requirements with minimal oversight. Combining these skills, these engineers face challenges across a wide variety of work centers at the company, and the team is frequently asked to tackle new, inter-departmental development projects. The ultimate goal of the Integration and Test team is to ensure that the Dragon 2 spacecraft interfaces successfully with the International Space Station, which is vital to the on-board astronaut crew and their missions.
