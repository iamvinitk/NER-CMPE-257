Who we are
A piece of the moon, a complete dinosaur skeleton, the Popes hat, the worlds smallest book - at Catawiki, we come across exceptional objects such as these every day. 
Catawiki is the leading online marketplace to buy and sell special objects. We offer over 75,000 special objects in auction every week â€” each reviewed and selected by one of Catawikis hundreds of in-house experts specialised in Art, Design, Jewellery, Fashion, Classic Cars, Collectables and many more.
Weve sold 10 million unique items to date and its our mission to become the worlds most popular auction destination for special objects.
Were an innovative, pioneering and fast-growing scale-up. If you think you can make a difference to our team, go ahead and apply.How we work
As the biggest marketplace for special items, Catawiki operates in a domain which brings plenty  of unusual challenges and opportunities. You will be developing, testing and scaling our microservices, mostly written in Ruby, to handle the high volume of requests served by the platform every single day. We do this by using Infrastructure as Code principles, collaborative peer-reviews, Continuous Delivery, AB testing every assumption and using the observability and monitoring tools already in place. We make mistakes and learn valuable lessons from them. Our focus is to be able to recover and iterate quickly.
What youll do   
Here at Catawiki, you will make an impact by improving and delivering product innovations for the Catawiki platform. Along with other members of the Development team, you will build scalable microservices while measuring and monitoring system performance. In addition, you will use experimentation, backed by data analysis, to add product features and deliver the best user experience on the platform.
What youll bring 
As a Staff Engineer you have a proven track record on influencing and guiding the development of the Back-End tech stack in your company. You have often operated outside of the boundaries of your team, and can give many examples on your effectiveness doing so. With Catawiki you will continue to do so.
With your extensive software engineering knowledge, you like to cooperate with engineers throughout the company, regularly focusing on cross-cutting business features, or just to help out your colleagues. You also provide guidance on a platform and company wide architectural level. Apart from this you have coached multiple engineers over the years, for longer periods of time, and you will apply your coaching skills in Catawiki to help your fellow engineers grow in the best possible way. 
Last but not least you have often (co-)created opportunity proposals and RFCs. You feel at home when you need to describe problems, opportunities, pros and cons of solution alternatives, and tying these to technical solution proposals, regularly comparing new techniques to proven existing techniques. You feel comfortable discussing your proposals with Product Managers, UX-designers and multiple Tech teams. As a passionate engineer, you bring these values to Catawiki:

You are a passionate experienced engineer with a strong eye for detail.
You strive to be a great team player and dont shy away from new challenges.
You are comfortable in a scale environment and are ready to jump in and help if needed.
You keep the companys values close to your heart and enjoy being in a diverse environment.

We look for engineers who are motivated to learn new things, ship new features, and pursue new and interesting challenges. Our stack is mainly focused around Ruby. However, if youre passionate about learning new things then prior experience with Ruby is not essential - we are used to onboarding engineers with a different programming language background. Next to this:

You have experience in designing, implementing and deploying backend services with a focus on high availability, low latency, and consistency.
You have proven experience of collaborating closely with other engineers to become a valued member of an autonomous, cross-functional team.
You understand the value that you can add to the business, the product and the impact of your work on customers.
