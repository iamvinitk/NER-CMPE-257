SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.ELECTROMAGNETIC ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TEST ENGINEERAs a member of our fast-paced Electromagnetic Environmental Effects team, you will be responsible for ensuring avionics hardware performance across our fleet of vehicles (Dragon, Falcon, Starship, Lunar Human Landing System, etc.) through some of the harshest and varied radiation environments imaginable. In order to ensure maximum reliability in non-ionizing radiation environments, the E3 team at SpaceX performs exhaustive analysis, design, and test at the component, board, unit, and subsystem levels with extensive opportunity to interact with a vast array of rocket and spacecraft hardware and electronics. As one of the few teams required to interface with the design, manufacturing, integration, and mission operations teams, we play a critical role in the development of our systems as we advance our efforts towards broadband satellite internet and safe, reliable, inexpensive, and innovative access to space. This work all supports our fundamental goal of expanding human space exploration capabilities and establishing a permanent human presence on the moon and Mars.RESPONSIBILITIES:Work with a team of technicians to conduct EMC testing for the components and systems on our vehicles and spacecraftDefine test requirements based on physics, rather than industry standardsCreate test plans, test procedures, and test reportsEnsure the electromagnetic compatibility of our systems, vehicles, and spacecraftVerify that designs meet the EMIEMC requirements that have been setInterface with, teach, and set requirements with various design teams all around the companyPerform and teach electromagnetic compatibility design and analysisDesign and perform tests to validate the following: effects of space plasma, lightning, surfacebulktriboelectric charging, circuit grounding architectures, structural bonding, circuit isolation, transfer impedance, shielding effectiveness, effects of radiatedconducted emissions  susceptibility, near fieldfar field electric fields, welding, corona, etcTroubleshoot EMI issues from board to system levelOperate a variety of EMI, RF, and electronics test equipmentIndependently perform verifications and document results in a clear, precise, and complete mannerSupport engineering management with confidence and think creativelyâ€”question the status quo, while following documentation and maintaining prescribed quality standardsBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in electrical engineering, physics, or other engineering discipline1 years of hardware-focused test engineering experiencePREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:A deep understanding of electromagnetic environmental effects is critical for this positionKnowledge of electromagnetic environmental effects including: effects of space plasma, on-orbit charging, triboelectric charging, groundingbondingshielding, design for low radiated emissions, HIRF, lightning, electromagnetic field coupling, Maxwells equations, image chargecurrent, and lumped element modelingDemonstrated experience troubleshooting circuit behavior on PCBAs andor test systems Demonstrated experience with MIL-STD-461, NASA-HDBK-4001, DO-160, MIL-STD-1541, SSP 30237, SSP 30238, SMC-S-008, and EN5503235Previous work experience with reading, interpreting and following: circuit schematics, PCB layouts, engineering drawings, BOMs, cable harnesses, wiring schematics, interface diagrams, layout drawings, mechanical drawings, and CAD softwareStrong knowledge in one or more of the following areas: plasmaspace physics, power electronics, RF engineering, etcExperience preferred in fast-paced work environment with productionflight hardwareAble to adapt to constantly changing work assignmentsExcellent concentration and attention to detail with outstanding work efficiency and accuracyExperience defining test requirements and test proceduresExcellent verbal and written communication skillsDemonstrated experience with test automationADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Must be able to lift up to 25 lbs. unassistedExtended hours and weekend work may be required to support critical project and mission milestonesAble to travel for short trips as needed COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:Pay Range:Electromagnetic Environmental Effects Test Engineer Level I: 100,000.00 - 120,000.00per yearElectromagnetic Environmental Effects Test Engineer Level II: 115,000.00 - 135,000.00per year Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
