Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.Team Description:
As a senior mechanical engineer at Neuralink, you will design and produce hardware solutions for our brain-computer interface devices, including surgical robotics, automation, microfabrication, and more. You will get to own projects from concept to production, utilizing your mechanical engineering background in the challenging field of brain-computer interfaces. The role involves collaboration with neuroscientists, biologists, and engineers to determine design criteria and build systems quickly and effectively.
The Robotics  Surgery Engineering Team tackles challenges across surgical robotics, such as creating next-gen hardware to drive total brain surgery time down from hours to seconds; designing laser-micromachining for micron-precision geometries for surgical end effectors; developing ways to reach deeper brain targets while balancing the competing goals of endpoint accuracy and minimally invasive insertion; and scaling from hundreds to millions of surgeries.
About you:

You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.
You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.
You are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software, mechanical, electrical, materials, biological engineers, and neuroscientists. You are comfortable communicating across teams.
Resourceful, flexible and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.
