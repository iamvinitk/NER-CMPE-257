At Coinbase, our mission is to increase economic freedom around the world, and we couldnt do this without hiring the best people.

There are a few things we look for across all hires we make at Coinbase, regardless of role or team.

Finally, we seek people who are excited to learn about and live crypto, because those are the folks who enjoy the intense moments in our sprint and recharge work culture. Were a remote-first company looking to hire the absolute best talent all over the world.
