iOS Engineer
At Lyft, our mission is to improve peoples lives with the worlds best transportation. To create the best transportation experience for all, we start in our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization where all team members are recognized for what they bring. We believe that trip by trip, were changing the way our world works. We imagine a world where cities feel small again, where transportation and tech bring people together, instead of taking them apart. We see the future as community-driven.
While we have a strong ride-sharing service in the US and in a few Canadian cities, we know that transportation isnt just about cars, its about enjoying the ride, no matter the method. Thats why Lyft leaned in to micromobility, first joining hands with Montreal-based 8D Technologies in 2018 (from Motivate) and later with Longueuil-based PBSC in 2022, taking the place of the worldwide leader in bike-sharing. We want to provide solutions that people love and cities need.
Our offices in the Greater Montreal developed the first automated bike-share system in America (Bixi), a system that has since been deployed in more than 51 cities in 15 countries: Barcelona, Buenos Aires, Chicago, Dubai, London, Mexico, Monaco, Montreal, New-York, San-Francisco, Toronto to name a few. These are also some of the biggest bike-share systems in the world, and the list keeps growing!
