Even if you might not meet every requirement, we strongly encourage you to apply. You might just be the right candidate for us. The Behaviors Teams at Cruise take a machine learning first approach to enable our AV to drive smoothly and safely in urban environments across all our markets. This includes: first predicting how the environment around the vehicle will evolve, then planning how the AV should respond based on that prediction, then generating safe  feasible trajectories to take our customers to their destinations. Underlying this, our engineers leverage a combination of imitation learning  reinforcement learning to build a continuous learning machine (link) that scales with on road data  simulation. The team is made up of practitioners from robotics, rankingrecommendations, relevance, NLUNLP, personalization, reinforcement learning, generative modeling and many other disciplines in the ML space.
What youll be doing:

Collaboratively define a technical vision and roadmap for the Planning stack
Provide technical leadership and mentorship to the team
Drive highly technical ML projects across multiple teams
Design and deploy ML models that enable safer, faster, and more human-like decision making
Design costs and cost formulations using data-driven and ML techniques to deliver a better ride experience
Train and deploy ML models that improve AV behavior and scale to multiple fleets, vehicle platforms, and cities.
Use state-of-the-art RL, IRL, and imitation learning techniques in a fast-paced research to production environment

What you must have: 

A proven record of shipping products in the real world.
Experience as a tech lead or technical manager, setting the technical direction for a team.
Strong communication skills and the ability to build consensus with a team of experts.

BS, MS, or higher degree, in CSCEEEME, or equivalent industry experience
5 years of experience working with ML in a robotics or safety critical environment or related field.
Strong experience with state-of-the-art Deep RL, IRL, and imitation learning
Expertise in C, Python, and modern software development environments and practices (familiarity with Git, Jira, for example)
Experience in applying ML techniques as part of a product, using a ML-hybrid architecture
Experience with the ML model lifecycle management (labeling, training, deployment, and maintenance)
Ability to clearly define and motivate problems and solutions in technical writing.

Bonus points!

Experience as a software engineer using ML techniques within robotics or safety-critical projects
Experience developing search-based planners
Experience with CUDAGPU programming
Experience developing custom ops for performant ML inference models.
Experience with ROS
Data science experience, including query of large databases, and data analysis
