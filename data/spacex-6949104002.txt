SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
PROPULSION ENGINEER (MERLIN DEVELOPMENT AND HARDWARE)
Merlin Propulsion Engineers are responsible for ensuring flightworthiness of engine hardware and software throughout the life cycleâ€”from initial build, through acceptance testing, and into flight (and re-flight) operations. You will exercise extreme ownership over engine hardware and drive all processes necessary to increase engine life as we continue to push the bounds of reusability. Additionally, you will be responsible for driving reliability-improving and rate-enabling initiatives to maintain the long-term success of Falcon as the most-flown, most-reliable launch vehicle in existence.
RESPONSIBILITIES:

Fully own critical spaceflight hardware  every employee at SpaceX assumes profound responsibility for their hardware
Lead Merlin development and qualification test campaigns as we continually extend qualified engine life
Perform design, analysis, development engineering, and flight operations tasks for Merlin engine propulsion systems
Interact with engineers and technicians from all disciplines, including production, test, launch, avionics, GNC (guidance, navigation  control), flight and ground software, mission management, flight reliability, and more
Work closely with commercial and governmental customers to ensure 100 mission success
Exercise risk-conscious decision-making skills under pressure
Implement and maintain rigorous hardware and software verification and validation processes through practical application of automation and process controls
Work closely with the launch sites to develop and improve critical inspection procedures
Lead anomaly investigations related to your hardware and rapidly push them to resolution while simultaneously implementing corrective actions to prevent reoccurrence
Practice flexible prioritization and scope management in order to deliver on group directives

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:

Bachelors degree in an engineering discipline
1 years of professional experience with hands-on hardware experience performing fabrication, assembly, andor testing
