Who we are
About Stripe
Stripe is a financial infrastructure platform for businesses. Millions of companies—from the worlds largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyones reach while doing the most important work of your career.
About the team
The Product Design team is composed of several teams that work together to help define, create, and deliver all user-facing aspects of the Stripe brand and product. Product Designers are strategic partners to Engineering and Product Management within a dedicated product area. In partnership with the product team, they help define the user-facing experiences our users encounter on Stripe products, then translate that thinking into a complete experience that can be tested, shipped, and refined. They are responsible for creating well-functioning and beautiful products and experiences that users love and are eager to recommend to others.
