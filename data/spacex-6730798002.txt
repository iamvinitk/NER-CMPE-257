SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.ELECTRICAL ENGINEER (INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS)This engineer is a systems focused, automation driven, multi-faceted individual. The engineer uses electrical and mechanical systems knowledge to inform the design of test stands, support facilities, avionics and control systems. SpaceX control engineers develop and integrate physical hardware including wire harnesses, PCBs, custom enclosures, PLCs, data acquisition systems, avionics systems, engine controllers, and various sensors. The engineer is responsible for the transference of real-time data from these physical sensors and actuators to the stand operator, responsible engineer, or customer. Test articles include in-space systems, vehicles, avionics systems, and ground systems. Excellent operational support and accurate interpretation of data collected from these test systems is paramount. These critical automation  controls systems support operations that enable safe, economical, and reliable access to space.RESPONSIBILITIES:Maintain the operational capability of all control voltage level (60V) electrical systemsDevelop and upgrade data acquisition and control systems Create new automation systems pertaining to avionics and engine testingProvide technical support and guidance for controls technicians and other non-controls engineering groupsDevelop new hardware and processes to improve capabilities, reduce cost, and setup time of electrical systemsAnalyze data to assess the function and health of electrical systemsAssist in the design and analysis of experiments to evaluate test articles BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in physics, electrical engineering or computer engineering6 months of experience working with data acquisition systems (internshipproject experience qualifies)PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Excellent communication skills, both written and verbalPassion for advancing the commercial space industry and human spaceflightStrong work ethic, positive attitude, and drive to succeed as part of a high functioning teamAbility to rapidly change rolesresponsibilities while working in a high-paced, challenging work environmentAbility to thrive in ambiguity, independently drive project progress, and manage multiple prioritiesKnowledge of high-reliability processes and related documentation practicesDemonstrated ability to design, implement and troubleshoot data acquisition and control hardwareFundamental understanding of engineering principles behind electronic equipment, instrumentation, and commonly used industrial equipmentExperience designing and installing instrumentation and control systems in hazardous areas (NFPA 70 Section 500 installations); class 1, division 1 and division 2 environments or IEC equivalenceFamiliarity with mixed signal electronics, power supply design, analog filtering; testing and troubleshooting techniques, signal integrity, layout and grounding principlesGeneral schematic capture and printed circuit board (PCB) design andor verification and validation experienceExperience with electrical power distribution, working knowledge of NFPA 70 and NFPA 70EFirst-hand experience with programming and software developmentExperience with industrial bus protocols such as Modbus, Profinet and EtherNetIPHands-on experience activating, building, and troubleshooting analog  digital electronic systems, including avionicsADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Ability to perform job duties that require standing, kneeling, crouching, twisting upper body, working in cramped positions in small openingsAbility to work at elevated heights (200 feet)Ability to perform physical tasks such as climbing up and down stairs andor ladders regularly throughout the dayAbility to lift light weight supplies or materials (up to 25lbs unassisted)Available to work extended hours and weekends when needed based on site operational needs; flexibility requiredWork performed in an environment requiring exposure to fumes, odors, flashing lights, heat, cold, rain, and noiseAbility to travel to other SpaceX or 3rd party facilities (up to 25)COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:        Pay range:    Electrical Engineer (Instrumentation and Controls)Level I:  100,000.00 - 120,000.00per year    Electrical Engineer (Instrumentation and Controls)Level II: 115,000.00 - 135,000.00per year    Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
