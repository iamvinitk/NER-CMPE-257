Supernal is at the forefront of creating emerging mobility solutions that will foster the development of human-centered cities. We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the worlds communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving peoples ability to move  whether for work or play.
What we do: 
The Sr. Thermal Controls Engineer plays a crucial role in the development of advanced control algorithms and electrical systems for our thermal management systems. This role demands expertise in designing and implementing control algorithms while ensuring the efficient and optimal operation of thermal management systems. This role will be challenged and provides solutions for a wide range of problems like optimal thermal controls of batteries, controls for the thermal management of electric power units, and aircraft air-conditioning system.
This position will be required to work on-site 5 days a week.
What you can do:

Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define and refine control system requirements for thermal management systems, incorporating components such as pumps, fans, valves, sensors, and more
Design, develop, and optimize control algorithms that ensure precise and reliable regulation of thermal management processes, achieving optimal performance, energy efficiency, and reliability
Conduct thorough analysis and simulation of control algorithms to validate their effectiveness and reliability in different operating scenarios
Ensure seamless integration of control algorithms with electrical and aircraft management systems software, including the design and configuration of electrical connections and communication protocols
Lead the testing and validation of control systems, both in simulation environments and real-world applications, and implement necessary adjustments for continuous improvement
Stay current with industry trends and emerging technologies related to thermal management, controls, and electric vehiclesaerospace applications, and apply this knowledge to enhance the design and functionality of our systems
May require up to 25 of domestic and international travel
