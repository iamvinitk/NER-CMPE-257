We believe work is better when people are in the same physical space together. At Unity, we offer a hybrid-first approach that fosters the alignment and connectedness we get from being together while retaining the benefits of flexibility. Employees are expected to work from an office on average 3-days a week unless otherwise agreed with the company or specified in their employment contract.
The opportunity
Unitys Security Operations (SecOps) team takes a different approach to security monitoring and response. Instead of hiring traditional Analysts who mainly prioritize automated findings and follow runbooks, we recruit individuals who have the skills and the desire to assume greater responsibility. Existing employees who fill this same role universally describe this as the most fulfilling job theyve ever had!
This role will regularly have the opportunity to meet with, and present to, Unitys Chief Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer. The analyst will work closely with their peers around the world, including Tel Aviv multiple locations in the United States. We have crafted the team structure and procedures specifically so that no one in this role is ever left on their own, without support or backup.
We will jointly build and maintain a career development plan, and work together to ensure that the Analyst is making regular progress towards their goals. This includes training, conferences, and, whenever possible, building the requisite skills and knowledge through the projects and tasks that they are assigned to.
