Were Cruise, a self-driving service designed for the cities we love.
Were building the worlds most advanced self-driving vehicles to safely connect people to the places, things, and experiences they care about. We believe self-driving vehicles will help save lives, reshape cities, give back time in transit, and restore freedom of movement for many.
In our cars, youre free to be yourself. Its the same here at Cruise. Were creating a culture that values the experiences and contributions of all of the unique individuals who collectively make up Cruise, so that every employee can do their best work. 
Cruise is committed to building a diverse, equitable, and inclusive environment, both in our workplace and in our products. If you are looking to play a part in making a positive impact in the world by advancing the revolutionary work of self-driving cars, come join us. Even if you might not meet every requirement, we strongly encourage you to apply. You might just be the right candidate for us. The Autonomous Vehicle (AV) software stack is a sophisticated workload that includes compute and data intensive functions within perception, prediction, planning and control. This role is within the ML Accelerators (MLA) team which is responsible for maintaining and optimizing the software stack for real-time, on-road performance. This means efficient workload mapping onto a sophisticated, resource-constrained hardware, co-architecting the HW platform with HW engineers and building platforms and tools for AI deployment and performance profiling, diagnosis and optimizations that can be employed by AV engineers (from perception, prediction, planning and controls). MLA engineers work in close collaboration with AV engineers throughout the lifecycle of crafting new AV features which is essential to the success of our mission.
As a Staff Software Engineer in Cruises Machine Learning Accelerators (MLA) Kernels and Libraries team, you will be responsible for the design and development of high-performance, safety-critical reliable accelerator solutions for Cruises AV workloads across our compute platforms. Your solutions will be used to implement the core AV functions across ML and non-ML workloads spanning multiple GPU architectures. As Cruise expands our vehicle offerings on our path to productization, your libraries will not only enable Cruises low cost custom silicon critical to our long term business needs, but also provide the needed performance portability to ensure our successful scaling.
What youll be doing:

Architect, design and develop accelerator libraries that are optimized across multiple architectures (custom accelerator inside AV and GPGPUs in the cloud).
Build optimized ML inference primitives and custom application workloads that support multiple accelerators.
Collaborate with compiler and runtime teams to build scalable interfaces for core primitive compute libraries, ML teams to guide the architecture of models and application teams to design the right algorithms that make efficient use of compute resources.
Own the performance of accelerator kernels and libraries used throughout the AV stack.
Create and implement coding standards, methodologies, processes, and guidelines. Coach and mentor team members on engineering excellence projects.
Partner with external vendors to deliver improvements and internal customers to drive requirements.

What you must have:

Excellent GPU programming skills in CUDA or OpenCL with a thorough understanding of parallel programming patterns and GPU architecture preferably across multiple vendors.
Strong background in software architecture, library design and design patterns.
Strong C programming skills with the ability to feel comfortable in large codebases.
Hands-on experience benchmarking, profiling, debugging and optimizing accelerator libraries and kernels to extract optimal performance.
Solid background in system performance, high performance computing and architecture-aware optimizations.
Strong communication, influence, and negotiation skills and the ability to work collaboratively within a team.
Exceptional leadership skills and ability to set direction and work through ambiguities
Minimum 5 years of relevant industry experience or equivalent experience

Bonus Points!

MS or PhD in CS, or related technical field or equivalent experience
Experience with GPU programming frameworks like SYCL, Triton, CUB, Thrust, CUTLASS and AITemplate
Experience with ML frameworks (e.g. Pytorch, JAX, Tensorflow)
Experience with ARM NEON, SVE, AVS or SSE-style SIMD intrinsics programming and libraries like Eigen, Highway and XNNPACK
Experience with DSP programming

The salary range for this position is 193,900 - 285,000. Compensation will vary depending on location, job-related knowledge, skills, and experience. You may also be offered a bonus, restricted stock units, and benefits. These ranges are subject to change.Why Cruise?

Were Integrated





Through our partnerships with General Motors and Honda, we are the only self-driving company with fully integrated manufacturing at scale.





Were Funded




GM, Honda, Microsoft, T. Rowe Price, and Walmart have invested billions in Cruise. Their backing for our technology demonstrates their confidence in our progress, team, and vision and makes us one of the leading autonomous vehicle organizations in the industry. Our deep resources greatly accelerate our operating speed.




Were Independent




We have our own governance, board of directors, equity, and investors. Our independence allows us to not just work on the edge of technology, but also define it.




Were Vested




You wont just own your work here, youll have the potential to own equity in Cruise, too. We are competing in a market that is projected to grow exponentially, which gives our company valuation room to grow. We offer a new kind of equity program called Recurring Liquidity Opportunity (RLO), which combines IPO-like liquidity with the stability of remaining private - learn more about RLO here
