Company Overview:
Second Order Effects (SOE) is an engineering consultancy that transforms uncertainty into fully functional hardware and software. We work on projects at various stages of development and scope; we perform analysis, build prototypes, and take products to market. Our cross-disciplinary team solves critical problems across numerous industries, including automotive, aerospace, consumer electronics, industrial automation, biomedical, green energy, and marine. Our designs control rocket engines, manage satellite communications, generate safety-overrides for self-driving cars, and are enjoyed by consumers around the world. 
Founded in 2016, Second Order Effects has 90 employees (and counting!) in offices in El Segundo, California and Redmond, Washington. Weve worked with 90 clients on 250 projects as a partner, on a retainer, or on demand, all of which have no involvement with weapons.
How do we do this? We prioritize others, build the right thing, welcome difficulty, and play the long game. Learn more at soeffects.com!
Team Overview:
SOE Seattle is Second Order Effects first expansion office. Established in January 2022, SOE Seattles goals are to build an office with skills in mixed signal electrical design, signal processing firmware, and sensor systems. As an early member of the team, you will be pivotal in the success of this office and future expansions.
The Advanced Projects team is a cross-functional, multidisciplinary group that handles requirements-driven hardware development projects. We are focused on engineering design, developing custom electronics to fulfill our clients needs, and identifying the best components and techniques to implement the desired functionality, while emphasizing quality and reliability. Our projects tend to be larger, longer-term engagements, though team members often split time across multiple projects.
We are looking for people who know how to get things done, who are always looking to grow their capabilities and deepen their knowledge, and who challenge assumptions, constantly pushing for better solutions and finding novel approaches to problems old and new. If that sounds like you, youve come to the right place.
Job Overview:
As an Electrical Engineer (Mixed-Signal  Analog), you will find the best solutions and implementations for the problems at hand by considering both hardware- and software-based approaches. You are an enthusiastic problem solver who can learn, invent, and execute creative solutions to drive forward difficult projects to ensure success.
What You Will Do:

Drive design efforts for electronic systems, including architecture and implementation details
Take ownership of technical projects from schematic capture and PCB layout through hardware bring-up and troubleshooting with clients
Perform component selection and trade studies of different implementation options to best generate and satisfy design requirements
Develop sensor interfaces and analog front-ends for data acquisition systems
General creative analog problem solving: design of analog controllers, current limiters, circuit health monitoring, etc.
Circuit simulation and thermal analysis of designs, including sizing of thermal management systems
Create documentation for electronic hardware and systems
Interface with internal teams and external clients to conduct design reviews for hardwareelectronic systems
Write and execute test plans for device validation and performance characterization

What You Will Need:

Bachelors Degree (Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, Math, related field)
3 years of experience working with analog or mixed-signal circuit designs, with a demonstrated passion for engineering and technology development
Excellent written and verbal technical communication skills; ability to explain technical concepts and their implications to non-technical audiences
Experience in any common ECAD tool, such as Altium Designer, KiCad, Cadence, PADS, EAGLE, etc.
Experience in modeling, simulation, and testing of electronics
Experience with analog small-signal circuit design (filters, op-amp circuits, signal conditioning) 
Experience with data acquisition, designing around ADCs and DACs
At least some exposure to power electronics design: regulators, load drivers, supply filters, protection circuitry

What Would Be Useful:

Masters degree (Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, Physics, Math, related field) or 5 years of relevant experience
Experience in team-based design and build projects (e.g., Formula SAE, Solar Car, CubeSat, Rover Challenge, etc.)
End-to-end electronics design experience: taking designs from requirements generation through schematic, layout, fabrication, and hardware bringup
Knowledge of PCB fabrication and assembly process, design for manufacture and design for assembly (DFM  DFA), familiarity with IPC andor JEDEC standards
Experience interfacing with PCB and assembly vendors to have designs fabricated
Large-format or high-density or high-layer-count PCB design experience, preferably for aerospace, automotive, medical, or other high-reliability applications
Expertise with Altium Designer or KiCad
Working knowledge of embedded systems: microcontrollers, ADCDAC systems, and common communication interfaces (e.g., UART, SPI, I2C, etc.)
Familiarity with Python andor MATLAB for data parsing and signal analysis
Familiarity with LTSpice for circuit simulation
