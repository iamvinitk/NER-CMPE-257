This team of incident response managers (IRM) is defined by our sense of ownership and how we drive incidents to resolution - marshaling the necessary cross-functional resources to respond to and resolve service outages, critical bugs, security attacks and anything that significantly impacts the users of our products. The team is user-first and ensures appropriate external communications from Stripe and senior management to keep our users informed of disruption to their experience of Stripe. The team is skilled in program management, communications, incident handling and technical adeptness as incidents can arise from anywhere and cut across products and orgs in Stripe.
