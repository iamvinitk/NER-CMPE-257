Klaviyo has a unique take on the Solution Architect role. While most companies hire SAs to give demos, fill out questionnaires, and explain complicated setups, that makes us yawn. We built a product that anyone can use (just ask our more than 100,000 customers) and we have smart sales reps and customer success colleagues who are true product experts. 
So what do we do? We work directly with a small percentage of prospective customers, alongside our sales  customer success teams, as customer-facing engineers to accelerate complex deals and customer value. We use these engagements as an opportunity to learn, prototype, and ship meaningful improvements to the Klaviyo experience. We look for interesting problems and aim for solutions that are extensible and reusable.
 
A few things our team has recently built as part of sales and customer engagements include: new productized integrations; modular ETL packages; a library of custom functions for importing data via API into Google Sheets; demo environments that continuously receive data in real-time; and an internal app to organize competitive intelligence. In short, we are problem-solvers and builders. We believe easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible. 
 
If youre an entrepreneurial engineer that gets excited by imagining new features, prototyping solutions, and incubating new technologies - all within the context of actual customer engagements - this could be for you. What youll get in return is the opportunity to be part of an extremely high-performing, strategically-important team that works at the exciting intersection of engineering, sales, and customer success.How Youll Make a Difference:
