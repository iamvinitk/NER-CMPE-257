SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal ofâ€¯enabling human life on Mars. 
SR. STRUCTURAL ENGINEER, STRUCTURAL TEST (STARSHIP) 
The Starship Structural Test team is responsible for testing the limit of Starships primary structure. We are seeking a senior structural engineer who will be both an individual contributor and a technical leader on large steel and steel reinforced concrete structural systems. You will architect, perform detailed design and analysis on, and build structures to apply flight-like loads to Starship test articles. Due to the iteration speed and scale of the loads you will be challenged to develop unique, fast to build, and cost-effective structures.
RESPONSIBILITIES: 
As a member of the team you can expect:

A dynamic role contributing technical expertise in design, analysis, and fabrication of large steel and composite steel and concrete structures
Work with vehicle and test engineers to develop test structures from conception. Your designs wont be isolated  they often interact directly with the rocket structure  so careful consideration of boundary conditions, load paths and stiffness will be necessary
Be responsible for fabrication planning and on-site fabrication support of your structures

BASIC QUALIFICATIONS: 

Bachelors degree in an engineering discipline
5 years of experience in engineering of composite steel and concrete structural systems used in large buildings, bridges, nuclear containment, test systems, or other large-scale applications
