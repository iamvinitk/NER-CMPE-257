Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.
Team Description: 
Come be a founding member of the nascent Surgery Reliability  Test Team, responsible for leveling-up surgery test infrastructure and driving continuous technical improvements to surgery. Build whatever is needed to (1) close the gap between mock-surgery testing and real surgery, and (2) enable a high cadence of representative mock-surgery testing to illuminate intermittent failure modes and facilitate rapid process improvement.
Example projects:

Design a surgical proxy that realistically tests robotic craniectomy RD
Design a spinal implant RD testbed that includes representative physiological motion and micromotion and reads implant health.
Implement a method for automatically gathering metrics from tests and surgeries (such as step times, tool use data, effect repeatability)
Build and scale a robust RD-to-production qualification test paradigm that maximizes test effectiveness while minimizing man hours
Lead root-cause investigations and update hardware designs as needed to optimize surgery

About you:

You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.
You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.
