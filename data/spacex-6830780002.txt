SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.ELECTRICAL DESIGN ENGINEER, AVIONICSAs an Electrical Engineer within Core Avionics, you will have the unique opportunity to explore all areas of a products life cycle from development through production and launch by engaging in multiple disciplines with a focus on electronic design, reliability, and manufacturing. You will be expected to analyze and troubleshoot electronic assemblies, define new processes, design circuitsfixturestools, and identify opportunities for improvement in both products and processes. You will have the opportunity to own a wide variety of components that enable SpaceX vehicles to provide the safest and most reliable access to space. Our fundamental goal is to allow humanity to explore the stars; with it comes an extreme responsibility to ensure the safety of the crew and payload.RESPONSIBILITIES:Develop high reliability spacecraft electronics for various launch vehiclesSupport or act as responsible engineer for flight hardware, from conception through build, qualification, and ultimately flight operationsPerform component selection, design analysis, schematic capture, prototyping, bring-up, debugging, circuit validation, and design documentation for electrical designsAssist with electrical architecture, product requirements, manufacturing planning, and production testExecute development and qualification testing campaigns to exercise designs to their limits and ensure reliable flight hardwareWork with experts from other teams and departments to ensure that fielded systems perform their function while being efficient, manufacturable, and reliable; challenge assumptions and build strong professional relationshipsBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in electrical engineering1 years of experience designing, building, or testing circuit boards or other electronics (research and extracurricular academic projects qualify)PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Ability to work in a fast paced, autonomously driven, and demanding atmosphereExperience with system trades and first-hand knowledge of how requirements tie hardware to larger systemsExperience designing signal conditioning and analog circuits, digital circuits, and switching power convertersExperience with schematic capture and board layout, preferably in Altium or Circuit MakerFamiliarity with circuit simulation tools and analysis methodsFamiliarity with lab equipment for development testing of circuits and componentsCapable of board level rework in support of development testingBasic first principles understanding of EMIEMC and common best practices for designFamiliarity with design-for-manufacture and design-for-costCapable of writing software for test automation, data review, and design analysis, preferably in MATLAB or PythonBasic project management skills and demonstrated ability to collaborate with other engineering disciplinesExcellent verbal and written communication skillsADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Extended hours and weekend work may be required to support critical project and mission milestonesCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:Pay range:    Electrical EngineerLevel I: 100,000.00 - 120,000.00per year    Electrical EngineerLevel II: 115,000.00 - 135,000.00per year        Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
