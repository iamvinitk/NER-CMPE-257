SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.MANUFACTURING ENGINEER (DRAGON STRUCTURES)As a Manufacturing Engineer at SpaceX, you will have the opportunity to utilize your knowledge, experience, and creativity to develop novel solutions at the cutting edge of space technology. You will work on launch vehicles and spacecraft that deliver satellites into earth orbit, ferry humans to and from the international space station, and ultimately extend humanitys reach beyond the earth and moon. You will be a vital part of the relationship between our development and production teams. You will provide input into the design and development of new and existing hardware and take a lead role in manufacturing and integration on our current and next generation vehicles.RESPONSIBILITIES: Responsible for the build and inspection process for composite structures across the Dragon 2 capsuleDevelop, qualify, and refine manufacturing processes to meet all design and business requirements including safety, quality, efficiency and deliveryCollaborate with other engineers, subject matter experts, and technicians to solve large-scale production challengesWork closely with design engineers to evaluate designs for manufacturability and implementation in a rapidly evolving production environmentResolve product non-conformances and collaborate with the quality team to implement root cause corrective actionsIdentify, plan, and execute capital equipment, machine, and layout upgrades to meet volume production demandDevelop and refine floor layouts, capacity models, and product flow analysis to ensure on-time vehicle delivery to manifestOversee composite hardware through production, including: lamination, machining, acceptance testing, and final assembly (bonded and bolted assemblies)Facilitate production of flight-qualified composites structures at increasing production rate while reducing costBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in an engineering discipline1 years of demonstrated hands-on experience in a manufacturing environment from industry, hobby, or through participation in collegiate engineering projects such as Formula SAE, Baja SAE, rocket club, CubeSat or Design Build FlyPREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Masters degree in mechanical, materials, or aerospace engineering2 years of industry experience (automotive, aviation or spacecraft manufacturing) working with composite structures andor large mechanical assemblies1 years experience with advanced composites manufacturing processes (out-of-autoclave prepreg processing, drilling and routing of composites, structural adhesives) for large scale, primary structures in a production environmentFamiliarity with test procedures and non-destructive evaluation of structural compositesExperience writing work instructions and procedures for critical aerospace hardwareExperience with validation testing for composite structuresMechanical component andor tooling design analysis experience using 3D CAD softwareExperience with design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA)Experience transitioning complex products from RD to rate manufacturing in a fast-paced environmentADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Position may require extended work hours and weekend workPosition may require standing, bending and working directly with hardware on the floor for extended periods of timeCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:Pay range:          Manufacturing EngineerLevel I: 95,000.00 - 115,000.00per year            Manufacturing EngineerLevel II: 110,000.00 - 130,000.00per yearYour actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
