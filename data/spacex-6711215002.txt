SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.APPLICATION SOFTWARE ENGINEER, DATAThe application software team is the central nervous system of SpaceX  we create mission critical applications that are used throughout SpaceX to accelerate launch vehicle production and flight as well as systems that allow Starlink to grow into a worldwide fast, reliable Internet service.We are looking for engineers who treat fellow teammates with fairness, respect, and support.Our team is creating systems to ingest and store concurrent streams of data from many always-on assets to manage the worlds largest satellite constellation, reusable rockets, and Dragon spacecraft. Other applications range from platforms that enable rapid build and reuse of Starship, designing the next generation manufacturing software that will be used in high throughput factories for Starlink, and public facing systems where customers can join our Starlink network globally.We work closely with engineers throughout the company to create and update our systems with respect to crewed launches, Starship flights, changes to the Starlink network and much more.Aerospace experience is not required to be successful here - rather we look for smart, motivated, collaborative engineers who love solving problems and want to make an impact on a super inspiring mission. You will have full ownership of challenging problems, working with a team of enthusiastic engineers to design and produce solutions that enable SpaceX to move towards our goals at a rapid pace.
