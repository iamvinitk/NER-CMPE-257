Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.The Community You Will Join
Airbnb is powered by our Host and Guest communities. Users are the center of the Airbnb platform. The Users team is responsible for everything related to building a holistic ecosystem around users, with the complexity ranging from individual travelers and hosts to large vacation rental businesses. 
Our work includes but not limited to:

User Platform: Build a User Entity Platform that enables every team on Airbnb to create exceptional user experiences. This includes consolidating user data across Airbnb into a single source of truth, building an end-to-end system from data model to the interface layers, and maintaining a cohesive lifecycle that encapsulates the user journey on Airbnb.
User Identity: Establish the User Identity workflows, policies, and account management to ensure every user account is verified and protected. Today, there are multiple ways of creating and deactivating accounts, and account management is not personalized based on the types of users. Our goal is to set up the right account structures and relationships that support a vast variety of user types and to unify the account creation and management. 
User Profile: Build a comprehensive and rich understanding of our Users that matches Guests with the perfect Hosts and Homes. We want to truly understand our users and personalize their experiences based on their needs.
User Reputation: Create a hospitality system that helps Airbnb and Hosts to deliver the magical stays. This requires collecting the right quality signals from users and synthesizing quality signals including reviews, customer service tickets, and others to form an accurate understanding of user reputation.
