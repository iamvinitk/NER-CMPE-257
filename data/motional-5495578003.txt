The team:
Your expertise writing robust software can make a key contribution to one of our core robotics teams, motion planning  controls. The software youll write will go directly on production ready autonomous vehicles and impact how they decide to drive. 
Our Motion Planning teams receive inputs on the many things going on around the vehicle (perception, localization, mapping) and then decides precisely what is the best plan and decisions to make in real time.  An example of motion planning includes building routes, navigating traffic, braking, acceleration, turning, lane-change among other actions, all while trying to optimize safety  comfort.
Youll have the opportunity to grow in robotics, including:

Learning how full end-to-end robotics systems work
Research and apply Motion Planning and Controls concepts in production-level software
Test code for autonomous vehicles in real-time environments

Our software developers practice clean and scalable code, which includes:
Problem solving:

Large groups of developers working on a shared codebase, documentation, and testing
Complex software projects with multiple processes and modules interaction
Design patterns
Realizing cutting edge robotics algorithms with limited compute resources in real-timesoft real-time environments

Software development practices:

Were driven by something more.
Our journey is always people first.
We arent just developing driverless cars; were creating safer roadways, more equitable transportation options, and making our communities better places to live, work, and connect. Our team is made up of engineers, researchers, innovators, dreamers and doers, who are creating a technology with the potential to transform the way we move.
Higher purpose, greater impact.
Were creating first-of-its-kind technology that will transform transportation. To do so successfully, we must design for everyone in our cities and on our roads. We believe in building a great place to work through a progressive, global culture that is diverse, inclusive, and ensures people feel valued at every level of the organization. Diversity helps us to see the world differently; its not only good for our business, its the right thing to do.  
Scale up, not starting up.
Our team is behind some of the industrys largest leaps forward, including the first fully-autonomous cross-country drive in the U.S, the launch of the worlds first robotaxi pilot, and operation of the worlds longest-standing public robotaxi fleet. Were driven to scale; were moving towards commercialization of our technology, and we need team members who are ready to embrace change and challenges.
