About Generate Biomedicines
Generate Biomedicines is a new kind of therapeutics company  existing at the intersection of machine learning, biological engineering, and medicine  pioneering Generative Biology to create breakthrough medicines where novel therapeutics are computationally generated, instead of being discovered. Generate has built a machine learning-powered biomedicines platform with the potential to generate new drugs across a wide range of biologic modalities. This platform represents a potentially fundamental shift in what is possible in the field of biotherapeutic development.
We pursue this audacious vision because we believe in the unique and revolutionary power of generative biology to radically transform the lives of billions, with an outsized opportunity for patients in need. We are seeking collaborative, relentless problem solvers that share our passion for impact to join us!
Generate was founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering and has received over 700 million in funding, providing the resources to rapidly scale the organization. The Company has offices in Somerville and Andover, Massachusetts with over 275 employees.
The Role: 
 
Generates technology platform combines generative AI to design novel proteins with the desired form and function, with aggressive automation to enable their synthesis and structural and functional characterization rapidly and at scale, in an iterative, self-optimizing manner. This design-make-test-learn cycle is orchestrated by a state-of-the-art data platform that enables seamless integration of the dry and wet labs and allows all measurements and metadata collected throughout the entire process to be easily captured, recorded, and utilized. Our toolset is anchored in a FAIR database that provides a common source of truth with robust and nimble data modeling capabilities, flexible integrations with third-party software, and a core suite of powerful applications that form the foundation of a unique company with equal parts bio and tech.
We are seeking curious, inventive, motivated, and collaborative software engineers to expand this data platform with new capabilities and achieve new levels of automation, precision, throughput, usability, and resilience. As a key member of the Engineering team within Generates Digital organization, the successful candidate will be responsible for designing and developing new software solutions to enable scalable capture, processing, storage, curation, standardization, integration, analysis, and interpretation of research, clinical, and translational data to drive operational efficiency and informed decision making. Working hand-in-hand with other engineers and scientists, they will drive product innovation by prototyping, launching, and continuously improving data-enabled capabilities to industrialize our technology platform, accelerate our therapeutic portfolio, and drive sustained market differentiation. They will use their exceptional design, engineering, and analytical skills to solicit, interpret, and contextualize user requirements and morph them into powerful, functional, and beautiful products that drive data utilization and a superior user experience. They will be active in the informatics and engineering community and contribute to attracting, retaining, and developing the best talent in a performance-driven organization.
We seek smart, focused, passionate self-starters who bring energy, new ideas, and practical experience to a fast-paced and dynamic team, are obsessed with delivering powerful, intuitive, and elegant software, and care deeply about their customers and each other.
