We focus on independent Registered Investment Advisers (RIAs), delivering financial products that advisors cant easily access today through beautiful, scalable, and easy-to-use technology.
Today, we work with over 600 RIAs that collectively represent more than 1.5T in assets under management across two products: Flourish Cash, a cash management solution with more than 3B in deposits, and Flourish Crypto, a turnkey cryptocurrency offering built for financial advisors and their clients. Headquartered in New York City, we are an independent subsidiary of MassMutual Life Insurance Company1.

About You
You solve problems with technology. You care deeply about the user experience, and are interested and passionate about building and shipping the visible part of products that real users interact with and trust. You can take a feature from designs to a performant end product that will delight users, building while taking into account good engineering and security practices. You thrive in a work environment that requires strong critical thinking skills and collaboration alongside periods of focus. You can give and receive thoughtful feedback, and are excited to start on the next iteration of your work. You are an effective written and oral communicator; owning and explaining complex technical concepts is an exciting prospect for you.
You understand UX and visual design fundamentals and have a feel for how they tie into building applications. You possess strong computer science fundamentals: data structures, algorithms, and information retrieval. And finally, your accomplishments and aspirations are much more important than your paper credentials.
