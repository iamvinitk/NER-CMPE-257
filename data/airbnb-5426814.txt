Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.The Community You Will Join: 
User Listing Marketplace Intelligence Machine Learning (ULM-ML) team: The ULM-ML team supports host personalization products and provides data driven solutions to achieve superior host experience on Airbnb. These products include but are not limited to manage your space (MYS), host quality standards, host pricing tooling, etc. As we are part of the platform team, there are also offline use cases that we support like HARE, Eve, etc. We own data pipelines and ML models (jointly with ULM LI, ULM DEAE) that are used in the above areas.
The Difference You Will Make:
There is a huge opportunity to improve the Host and Guest experience by leveraging open source, third party, and home grown ML models. As a staff engineer, you will partner closely with our data science, product partners, and other ML  data engineers on the team to execute on these opportunities in order to improve the Host and Guest product experience on Airbnb.
