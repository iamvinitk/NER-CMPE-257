Mission Summary:
The Release Operations Engineer is a cross-team integration role on the AV Performance Analysis (Triage) team under the COO organization to deliver capabilities in support of maintaining a high level of system quality and vehicle behavior for our autonomous driving technology. Experience with system and sub-system level verification, release management, regression analysis methodologies, systems and safety product lifecycles with cross-team collaboration across software, testing and project management groups is a must. Different from a traditional Software Quality Assurance (SQA) role, this position uniquely cross-cuts across testing and operations functions on the right half of the systems V-model and software development, systems and safety engineering functions on the left half of the V-model.
What youll be doing: 

Execute on cross-team Triage integration responsibilities, such as reporting on the release performance to the algorithm engineering groups and objectively evaluating the impact of software changes on the vehicle performance
Drive the day-to-day software release performance narrative. Identify performance regressions and coordinate with Test, Operations, Safety, Engineering teams for an expedited resolution
Facilitate cross functional engagement for high impact issues identified during the software release lifecycle; including process, technical and operational problems.
Support coordination, analysis of corrective and continuous regression testing across multiple concurrent software branches. Additionally contribute to building engineering post mortems on organizational blockers for leadership visibility.
Understand and optimize cross-functional release processes to reduce the risk of major code bugs being hidden in formal software releases
Consistently develop software release report-cards, weekly summaries while outbriefing such content to cross functional senior management and Triage stakeholders
Develop documentation such as software release reports and outbrief content to the Triage external stakeholders
Partner closely with the engineering and operational teams on integrating Motionals commercial missions into the end-to-end Triage pipeline
Perform detailed Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Fault Tree Assessment (FTA), Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA) on several different test modalities such as -- public roads, closed course, simulation and Hardware-in-Loop (HIL)
Cultivate and maintain rapport with the software development teams to encourage rapid and iterative feedback loops
Develop and maintain core internal documentation like process training and lessons learned register to support Triage team
Other duties as assigned, such as visiting track for new test case execution or supporting analysis of adhoc priority testing with commercial partners
