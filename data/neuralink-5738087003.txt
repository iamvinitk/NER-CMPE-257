Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.Team Description:
Join the implant team and be part of an elite team of engineers working on high-performance, safety-critical embedded systems for the next-generation brain-computer interfaces. We are looking for experienced, hands-on engineers who are interested in exploring whats possible in highly powered and latency-constrained environments. Firmware is the kernel of operation for the implant and you have the chance to determine and implement features that have a massive impact on the products capabilities. You will have the opportunity to work closely with chip designers, EEs, algorithms, and software engineers on a small team that moves quickly.
Job Responsibilities and Description: 

You find enormous challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.
You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting design, but in the end, you know that delivering reliable manufacturable solutions matters.
