SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
PROPULSION ENGINEER (MERLIN FLIGHT OPERATIONS)
The Merlin Flight Operations team is dedicated to delivering Falcon and its payloads to orbit rapidly and reliably. The Propulsion Engineers on this team are responsible for ensuring flightworthiness of Merlin engine hardware and software over the life cycle of the engine, from initial build, through acceptance testing, and into flight (and re-flight) operations. Additionally, Propulsion Engineers are responsible for driving reliability-improving and rate-enabling initiatives to maintain the long-term success of Falcon as the most-flown, most-reliable launch vehicle in existence.
RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Develop a comprehensive understanding of the Merlin engine and its operation
Make critical decisions for the processing of Merlin engine hardware during build, test, integration, and flight to ensure 100 mission success
Define, implement, and validate engine acceptance and operational requirements to promote reliability, rapid reusability, and streamlined processing of engines
Take on primary responsibility for the success of Merlin engine(s) for a given test or launch campaign. Support test and launch operations across all SpaceX facilities, including live on-console support from Mission Control
Perform post-test and post-flight data reviews, and provide technical recommendations to Vehicle Maintenance team to enable rapid, reliable reuse of hardware
Solve undefined and multi-disciplinary problems, interfacing with engineering and technician teams from all disciplines across SpaceX (e.g., production, test, launch, stage propulsion, avionics, structures, guidance, navigation  control, thermal and fluid analysis, flight and ground software, mission management, flight reliability, etc.)
Work closely with commercial and government customers to drive down technical debt, mitigate flight risks, and ensure maximum hardware and software reliability
Lead engine anomaly investigations and drive these investigations to resolution
Develop new automation capabilities to enable extreme launch cadence  leverage coding for rapid test and flight data analysis, flight software verification, and other engineering processes and eliminate recurring work
Optimize recurring test and mission tasks to enable an increasingly demanding launch manifest
