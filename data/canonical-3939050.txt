We are scaling the Ubuntu Foundations Team which delivers the essential components of Ubuntu - our system startup, compilers, language runtimes and toolchains, as well as networking and storage config and management - and we are hiring engineering managers to enable that growth. These are highly technical management roles which require deep knowledge of the core of a Linux server system.
As an Engineering Manager on the Foundations team, you must be passionate about the future of Ubuntu, mindful of the dynamics of the open source ecosystem, and equally aware of the needs of enterprise technologists. You will work closely with product managers to define and deliver the Ubuntu roadmap.
Your primary responsibility is to your team: helping them grow as engineers, do important and satisfying work, and have a great time while doing it. Technical leadership experience and a background in software engineering are necessary prerequisites for this role. You will be expected to lead, challenge, and develop strong engineers, positively influence the culture, facilitate technical delivery, and work with your team on strategy and execution.
This Engineering Management role is an opportunity for a technologist with a passion for Linux and Ubuntu to build a career with Canonical and drive the success of the business. If you have an affinity for open source development, then you will enjoy working with some of the best people in the industry at Canonical.
