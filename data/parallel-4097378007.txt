Parallel Systems is a Series A startup company developing the future of intermodal transportation. Our mission is to decarbonize freight while improving supply chain logistics and safety. We are developing vehicles and software to create new autonomous and electric transportation systems for existing rail infrastructure.
At Parallel Systems, we value the team as much as the mission. We want to work with talented people who are humble, motivated, and persistent. Our most successful team members are self-starters and collaborate with others to reach our collective goals.Were looking for a talented Mechanical Engineer to design components and test the system with a focus on the Traction System based onsite at our Downtown Los Angeles HQ office. In this role, youll work with fellow engineers and technicians to bring up new designs in our lab and run vehicles on our dedicated test track just outside the city. This is an opportunity to engage early with new designs, making a big impact on the direction of the technology. Ideal candidates have experience developing products on first principles and engineering skills and have a desire to expand their responsibilities to own hardware designs. 
Responsibilities  

Derive architecture, meet and present technical direction, build consensus. Work closely with multi-disciplinary engineering teams
Full life cycle hardware development including requirements capture, prototyping, design validation, and manufacturing readiness
Create and execute design of experiments for decisions on architecture, component selection, and manufacturing processes
Support manufacturing, vehicle integration, and validation
Design and develop electric traction systems (motors, inverters, gearbox)

Determine motor requirements and sourcing hardware
Develop motor capabilities and test campaigns for acceptance and validation
Design interfacing systems (cooling, mechanical coupling, mounting)



 
Basic Qualifications 

BS in Mechanical Engineering or similar Engineering discipline
