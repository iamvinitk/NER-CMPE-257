Supernal is at the forefront of creating emerging mobility solutions that will foster the development of human-centered cities. We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the worlds communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving peoples ability to move  whether for work or play.
What we do: 
The Flight Technology Department is looking for a Lead Dynamics Engineer to coordinate structural dynamics and rotor dynamics with the testing organization. Key responsibilities include modal analysis investigation of structural components, supporting the safe expansion of rotor and flight testing envelopes, and vibration predictions and mitigations. The engineer will interface regularly with other groups within the Flight Technology Department but also other groups in Airframe, Systems, Test, Certification.
This position will be required to work on-site 5 days a week.
What you can do:

Provide in-depth analysis of vibroacousticstructural dynamics phenomena (transmission, radiation, propagation, )
Predict vibration response at different locations of the aircraft structure and verifyvalidate with test results
Achieve vibration qualification of cabin interiors, instruments, and equipment
Lead and participate in the definition of ground and flight test objectives for eVTOL rotor and airframe systems
Lead and participate in the development of the set of test conditions to be investigated
Lead the diagnosis of structural dynamics and vibration problems identified during the test
Participate in the resolution of dynamics and vibration problems
Lead the efforts to develop vibration reduction and isolation using passive and active methods, preferably at the source
Plan, lead, and coordinate activities with other teams
Travel, as needed, up to 50, primarily to our local California Proving Grounds in the Mojave desert (California City)
Other duties as assigned

What you can contribute:
