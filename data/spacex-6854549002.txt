TEAM DESCRIPTIONS:
APPLICATION SOFTWARE: The Application software team is currently creating and evolving systems to enable rapid build and reuse of Starship as well as designing the next generation manufacturing software that will be used in high throughput factories for Starlink. Other applications range from platforms that support concurrent streams of data from many always-on assets to manage the worlds largest satellite constellation to public facing systems where customers can join our Starlink network globally. We work closely with engineers throughout the company to create and update our systems with respect to crewed launches, Starship flights, changes to the Starlink network and much more.
DRAGON SOFTWARE: As a software engineering intern on the Dragon Software team, you will develop, analyze and verify the mission critical software configurations that fly our Dragon Crewed and Cargo vehicles. You will partner cross-functionally to ensure software is configured to each missions specifications and needs. You will be responsible for ensuring the vehicle behaves as expected, and troubleshooting flight software when necessary. You will have a direct impact on our ability to launch and fly vehicles frequently, safely and reliably.
FALCON SOFTWARE: As a software engineering intern on the Falcon Software team, you will develop, analyze and verify the mission critical software that flies our Falcon and Falcon Heavy launch vehicles. You will be responsible for ensuring the vehicle behaves as expected, is adequately tested prior to launches, and troubleshoot flight software when necessary. You will have a direct impact on our ability to launch and fly vehicles frequently, safely and reliably.
GUIDANCE, NAVIGATION  CONTROL (GNC): The GNC teams at SpaceX support our Dragon, Falcon, Starlink, Starshield and Starship programs by developing highly reliable and performant GNC algorithms, simulations, tools, services, and dashboards.
