As a senior engineer we will look to you to help bring up the quality of our deliveries and help to engage the team in leading the quality and outcomes of their work.

Not afraid to fail. We take informed risks and chances, they often work, sometimes they dont. You learn from those mistakes and incorporate them into how you think in the future
Aware that fast and quality are not mutually exclusive. We can deliver high quality, well engineered code fast. You do not cut quality first to meet timelines, you often thoughtfully try to determine how to do both
Interested in being a mentor and a teacher to make those around you better. We arent perfect, neither, are you. You believe that together we are more than the sum of our parts and you expect others to help you to grow and learn too
