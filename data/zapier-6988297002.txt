About You


Youre an experienced database technologist with a background in PostgreSQL. You have at least 7 years of experience in systems administration, systems engineering, or software development, with at least 4 years of experience building and maintaining data services on PostgreSQL.  Youre familiar with PostgreSQL ecosystem of extensions and third-party tools, and have leveraged them to build production systems.


You know the cloud. Youve designed and maintained highly available, cloud-based database systems in AWS or another cloud platform. We use tools like Postgres, MySQL, and Redis.


You can code. Youre comfortable automating solutions and building tools that eliminate repetitive tasks. Youre not afraid to delve into application code to fix a bug or to launch a backend service to address a gap in our data management strategy.


You can solve complex systems challenges. You take ownership of difficult problems, understand how to improve performance, and help uncover opportunities for improvement. Youve worked on issues where just throw more hardware at it isnt enough for the system to scale.


Youre a great communicator. Not only do you know how to share your knowledge with the team and document things well so they can be consumed asynchronous (we do this a lot as a remote company), but you know how to communicate effectively with software and support teams.


You value our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we work together and how we think about our customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust and ensure we work together and collaborate to democratize automation. You see how these values can empower meaningful work, you thrive in a collaborative setting, you are eager to continue growing, and youre excited to be part of the team


Things Youll Do


Identifying and implementing strategies to improve performance and resilience. Our application is continually growing and we need your help to keep scaling.


Working with development teams to make architectural decisions about new services and new technologies.  Many of our new services use Postgres and teams need your help understanding how to best use it.


Streamlining how developers get from zero to a scalable, performant, and secure database, so that they can focus on building great services.


Monitoring use of our data layer and advising teams on how to use storage in a healthy and scalable way.


Acting as a point of escalation for data-layer problems during production incidents.

And more!

Things Weve Done Recently


Added new monitoring tooling across our fleet of RDS databases for improved observability;


Rebuilt our connection pooling to our main production database to make it faster and easier to deploy config changes;


Removed low-value code and tables from our system, cutting database traffic by 15;


Migrated portions of a shared EAV datastore into our relational databases, eliminating a single point of failure across multiple services;


Helped a team developing a critical new service to ensure their database could scale with their expected traffic
