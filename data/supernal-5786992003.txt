Supernal is at the forefront of creating emerging mobility solutions that will foster the development of human-centered cities. We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the worlds communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving peoples ability to move  whether for work or play.
 
What we do: 
The Energy Management System Control Engineering team is dedicated to researching and developing control algorithms for power distribution and redundancy management in our HV distribution system and Energy Storage System (ESS). The Sr. Algorithm Engineer is responsible for developing algorithm requirements, conducting research and development, and verifying algorithms after implementation. They work closely with other Hardware, Software, and Cell Engineers in the Battery team, as well as other multi-functional team members, to establish algorithm requirements and ensure traceability. They also support integration testing at the Powertrain, ESS system, or Aircraft level.
This position will be required to work on-site 5 days a week.
What you can do:

Develop Diagnostic Algorithms for detecting and mitigating faults for energy storage and distribution systems with redundancy
Develop a strategy to identify faulty systems and select the functioning system from redundant sources
Research  develop algorithms for in-range fault detection, operate through failure design considering system reaction times for faulty data and fault detection latencies
Develop functionally safe control architectures for safety critical systems to be used in aerospace applications
Simulation and verification of models and algorithms developed using MIL, SIL, PIL, and HIL techniques at HV battery systems or at the HV power distribution level and support similar activities at the system level (System in the Loop testing)
Optimization of algorithms and control loops to work within real-time computer resource constraints like CPU cycles, memory, and power consumption
May require up to 25 of domestic and international travel
Other duties as assigned

What you can contribute:

Bachelors degree in Control Systems Electrical Engineering or related field required; Masters degree preferred
A minimum of five (5) years of demonstrated diagnostic algorithm development experience in automotive or aerospace industries (an equivalent combination of education and experience may be considered)
Experience in developing algorithms to detect continuity faults and in-range faults and take action to mitigate the effects of the fault
Ability to create control algorithms for fault tolerant systems with redundancy management for a product in service
Experience in developing control algorithms and software for safety-critical applications compliance to DO178C standards; Understanding of DO-178C compliance for SW development is required
Proficiency in using modeling and analysis tools like MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow, Simscape, or others
Proficiency in programming languages such as C and C is vital for developing real-time applications
Experience in implementing diagnostic algorithms in C and C in embedded environments
Have an understanding of battery cell characteristics, the operational characteristics of electrical components, and the possible failure modes of sensors and actuators
Excellent skills required in technical communication and reliance on data for issue resolution and decision-making
Excellent verbal and written communication skills
Proactive delivery of communication and follow up
Excellent organizational skills and attention to detail
Must have the ability to independently prioritize and accomplish work within time constraints
Proficiency with Excel VLOOKUP, pivot tables, MS Office Suite

You may also be able to contribute:

Experience with DFMEA preferred
