SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.TEST EQUIPMENT ENGINEERAggressively-paced, constantly-evolving, results-focused, real-as-it-gets engineering positions available for the ambitious. We design, build, activate, modify, improve, and maintain the structures and fluid systems that feed, hold down, and measure the most powerful high-volume rocket engines in the world. Aimed at pivoting and fixing issues every day, you can plan on having your skills put to the test, having hardware you designed made and installed same day in a development-focused environment. From thousands of gallons per minute of cryogens to tens of pounds per second of high-pressure gas, we develop clever solutions to meet the needs of a demanding test program both today and for the future. We have open positions ranging from entry level to very experienced engineering for adding value to the overall mission.RESPONSIBILITIES:Analyze, design, and build of systems that support critical rocket engine and component testingCradle-to-grave project ownership through hosting design reviews, project decision justification, equipment procurement, and coordination and assistance of the construction of your ideasWork directly with technicians to build your designs, and fix real-world problems on the flyMaintain a tight feedback loop with the test operations team to rapidly alter plans as necessary to meet tight testing deadlinesOperate and troubleshoot equipment to achieve testing objectives and iterate system maintenance strategies to reduce future downtimesIndependently evaluates complex problems and arrives to solutions to seemingly impractical problems that best support the test program and achieving company objectivesHands-on approach to tackling daily field projects necessary to keep the company testing rocket engines every single dayBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, or other engineering disciplines1 years of hands-on build or design experience (experience from internships, clubs or other engineering activities qualifies)PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Ability to work independently and in a team, take initiative, and communicate effectivelyAbility to rapidly change rolesresponsibilities while maintaining a high sense of urgency in a high-paced, challenging work environmentWillingness to perform other related duties for the purpose of ensuring an efficient and effective work environmentExperience with quick-thinking and problem solving in stressful situationsGood response to challenges posed by short deadlinesGood fundamental intuition of fluid andor structuralmechanical systemsCreativity to imagine and design for reliability, efficiency, and maintainability from scratchGeneral hands-on experience; machining, welding, and other fabrication techniques is a plusInstrumentation, testing, data review and analysis, verification against a model3 years of mechanical design experience in an industrial setting or equivalentExperience with high pressure and cryogenic fluid systems and componentsExperience producing drawings for welders and machine shop fabricationCollaborative team player, eager to find the best solution while balancing cost and scheduleAcute attention to detail, ability to see interactions with other systems to avoid problemsIntermediate skill level using CAD (NX a plus)Ability to verify designs with simplified hand calculations; experience in FEA or CFD is a plusASME piping and pressure vessel design experienceCreative and passionate approach to addressing opportunities and challenges, and an enthusiastic, self-motivated, positive can-do attitudeExcellent written and verbal communication skillsADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Able to respond to emergencies to support priority projects, missions, and launchesAvailable to work extended hours and weekends as needed; flexibility is requiredAble to work in extreme outdoor environments when needed  heat, cold, wind, rain, etc.Able to work in an environment requiring exposure to fumes, odors, and noiseWorking conditions may be in tight quarters and physical dexterity is requiredAbility to perform job duties that require standing, kneeling, crouching, twisting upper body, working in cramped positions in small openings, and climbing hand over handAble to lift heavy objects up to 25 lbs unassistedAbility to work on ladders, lifts, and at elevated heights (up to 300 feet) with proper PPECOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:        Pay range:    Test Equipment EngineerLevel I: 95,000.00 - 115,000.00per year    Test Equipment EngineerLevel II: 110,000.00 - 130,000.00per year    Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
