SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.RF TEST ENGINEERAs an RF Test Engineer, you will have the unique opportunity to design and develop test systems for all the RF systems on our rockets and spacecraft. This includes but is not limited to: communication systems, GPS, RADAR, antennas, amplifiers, and wide range of analog and digital circuit boards with RF signal conditioning. You will be expected to create new test systems from the ground up, and your work will be critical to the reliability, communication, and safety of our vehicles. Our fundamental goal is to allow humanity to explore the stars; with it comes extreme responsibility to ensure the safety of the crew and payload.RESPONSIBILITIES: Design and troubleshoot RF (UHF, S-Band, X, Ka, or Ku bands) test setups and associated support equipment to execute testing strategiesWrite automation software in Python to interact with units under test, test equipment, instrumentation, and production documentation systemsWork closely with and consistently provide feedback to responsible design engineers, manufacturing engineers, and test lab teams to drive design or infrastructure improvements to increase product reliability and yieldRoot-cause test failures to ensure issues are understood and develop and implement mitigations as part of a process of continuous improvementBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in electrical engineering, computer science, or physics2 years of experience with RF systemsExperience with object-oriented programmingPREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Masters degree in an RF engineering disciplineCreative problem solver that can bring multiple disciplines together with the ability to assess risk and make design and development decisions without all available dataExperience with electronic components, wire harnesses, and electrical test equipment (spectrum analyzers, network analyzers, oscilloscopes, power supplies, etc.)Understanding of RF schematics and RF electronics manufacturing to analyze and improve test coverageKnowledge of digital communication systems, spread spectrum, single and multi-carrier techniques and modulation types such as QPSK, APSK and QAMUnderstanding and experience in environmental testing such as vibration, shock, thermal, burn-in, and TVACExperience qualifying RF products for aerospace capabilitiesStrong sense of accountability and integrity with excellent written and verbal communication skillsAbility to work in a fast paced, autonomously driven, and demanding atmosphereCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:        Pay range:    RF Test EngineerLevel I: 100,000.00 - 120,000.00per year    RF Test EngineerLevel II: 115,000.00 - 135,000.00per year        Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
