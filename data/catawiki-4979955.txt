Meet Virginia, our former People Growth  Experience Intern 
As a People Experience  Growth intern, I had the opportunity to gain valuable practical experience. During my time at Catawiki, I was constantly challenged and encouraged to grow both personally and professionally. I was given the opportunity to work on interesting projects, such as those related to environmental sustainability and employee well-being. All this alongside very talented people who were always willing to share their knowledge and skills with me.
My experience at Catawiki has been wonderful. The companys culture of inclusion, innovation and creativity has made the working environment enjoyable and fulfilling. They turned out to be a company open to cutting-edge projects like the one I conducted for my thesis project. I am grateful for the opportunity to have been part of such an outstanding team and I am sure that the skills and knowledge I gained during my internship will be useful for my future activities.
