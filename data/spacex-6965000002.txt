SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.
SR. GROUND SEGMENT OPS ENGINEER
The SpaceX Ground Segment team is responsible for solving a wide array of communications challenges. We deploy, operate, and support our ever-growing worldwide launch pad network of communications antennas, optical tracking systems, and Starlink telemetry, tracking, and control antennas.
As an Automation and Operations Engineer, you are responsible for the collection of all critical telemetry required to verify orbital parameters, observe payload deploys, communicate with astronauts, and meet space flight regulations. You will be in direct control of the ground systems throughout the mission, starting with ground integration through launch and on-orbit operations. As a Ground Segment operator, you will be a core part of live, on-console operations in SpaceX mission control, where you will be problem-solving in real-time and making data-driven decisions to ensure success.
While not in the control room, you will maintain the teams operational foundation by authoring procedures, writing and testing automation, and performing mission planning for all ground communications infrastructure supporting Falcon and Dragon missions. Your daily efforts to optimize ground station coverage will put you in direct contact with customers as well as vehicle, ground support, mission design teams. You will collaborate with subsystem responsible engineers, software engineers, and electrical design engineers to understand and evaluate how the ground segment assets should be operated and then execute on that vision. Working as a cross-disciplinary expert, you will ensure that the software and automation running the full system is safe and reliable.
