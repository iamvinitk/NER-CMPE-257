This role is one of our general tracks. Apply here for all engineering teams at Canonical who work on low-level system technology and embedded systems, across all seniority levels.
We hire careful and conscientious engineers who appreciate the challenge of memory, performance, battery and connectivity constrained code that has to work every time in an unreliable and unforgiving world, on x86, ARM or RISC-V silicon.
Canonical Ubuntu is the leading Linux for software engineers, desktops, cloud and IoT. We bring open source to the world as a high-performance, safe and secure platform for enterprise computing, software engineering, and connected devices.
These smart, connected devices have the potential to transform every industry. Classic Ubuntu  desktop or server  is widely used in embedded systems because of its developer focus and enterprise grade security maintenance. We partner with the worlds most prominent silicon companies to optimise Ubuntu on their latest and greatest chips, as well as with major OEMs and ODMs (PC, servers and connected device manufacturers) to ensure that Ubuntu works perfectly on their hardware.
But while classic, deb based Ubuntu is ideal for developers, it has too much variability for appliance or connected device environments, where you want to know exactly what the state of millions or billions of devices might be. So Canonical builds Ubuntu Core, a fully containerised version of Ubuntu that is mathematically precise and rigorously secure. We are working on additional solutions for even smaller devices.
We have several teams that focus on open source for embedded environments. We hire outstanding Linux and RTOS software engineers with a passion for open source, innovation, cutting-edge hardware and software technologies in general. You will be expected to make significant contributions through high-quality design and code, and to develop your technical leadership.
These roles include:

Ubuntu Core and snapd software development 
Silicon software and optimisation engineers 
Kernel driver and hardware enablement engineers 
Hardware-centric Linux QA Engineers 
Hardware Certification Engineers 
Robotics engineers 
Industrial IoT software engineers 
Networking software engineers (switching, routing, access and SmartNICs)

At Canonical you will have the opportunity to engage with the broader open source community. Were looking for individuals who can help build a thriving community, contribute to a broad range of technologies, and contribute to the deployment of Ubuntu and Ubuntu Core across the widest range of devices.
Location: we have remote roles open in every time zone.
