SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.INSTRUMENTATION  CONTROL SYSTEMS TECHNICIANThe Data and Control Systems Technician will support the build-up and maintenance of our data and control systems.
