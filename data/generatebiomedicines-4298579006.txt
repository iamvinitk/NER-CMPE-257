About Generate Biomedicines
Generate Biomedicines is a new kind of therapeutics company  existing at the intersection of machine learning, biological engineering, and medicine  pioneering Generative Biology to create breakthrough medicines where novel therapeutics are computationally generated, instead of being discovered. Generate has built a machine learning-powered biomedicines platform with the potential to generate new drugs across a wide range of biologic modalities. This platform represents a potentially fundamental shift in what is possible in the field of biotherapeutic development.
We pursue this audacious vision because we believe in the unique and revolutionary power of generative biology to radically transform the lives of billions, with an outsized opportunity for patients in need. We are seeking collaborative, relentless problem solvers that share our passion for impact to join us!
Generate was founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering and has received nearly 700 million in funding, providing the resources to rapidly scale the organization. The Company has offices in Somerville and Andover, Massachusetts with over 275 employees.
The Role:
Generate is seeking a highly experienced senior scientific leader to lead our protein analytics and biophysics team. This leader will be responsible for a team that brings together advanced biophysical instrumentation measuring protein-protein interactions with state-of-the-art analytical characterization technology, all at the intersection of machine learning. The Senior Director will manage a growing team of scientists and research associates, as well as other senior leaders within the team. The ideal candidate will have a proven track record of leading early and late-stage physiochemical analyses of biologics including monoclonal antibodies, bimulti-specifics, peptides, and enzymes in a Pharma or Biotech setting.
Candidates must have demonstrated prior hands-on experience with method development and execution with techniques such as HPLCUPLC (SEC, RP, HIC, IEX), light scattering (SEC-MALS, DLS), thermal stability (DSF, DSC), capillary electrophoresis-based methods (CE-SDS, cIEF), liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LCMS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), bio-layer interferometry (BLI), kinetic exclusion assay (KinExa), as well as other protein-protein interaction techniques. Shehe will provide leadership within project teams to facilitate project advancement and data feedback to our machine learning platform. The Senior Director will work closely with our Computational Sciences, Protein Sciences, and CMCTech-Ops departments in the planning and execution of our various protein characterization initiatives, spanning early Generation through late-stage Candidate Selection. They will be responsible for helping to drive the broader strategy of our protein analytics biophysics workflows, including goal setting, resource tracking, and data feedback to our machine learning platform.
