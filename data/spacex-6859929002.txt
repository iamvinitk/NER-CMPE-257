SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.TEST ENGINEER (FALCON TEST)At SpaceX, our commitment to reliability begins with design but is realized through exhaustive testing at the Rocket Development Facility in McGregor, TX. In order to eliminate anomalies and ensure maximum product quality, the test team pushes our hardware to its limits in as close to flight like conditions as possible. Test Engineers are ultimately responsible for the entire test process. They develop test requirements, handle the test articles, operate test stand systems, conduct tests, analyze data to confirm performance and inform the designproduction process. RESPONSIBILITIES: Test rocket hardware to determine suitability for flightProvide on-console engineering support for technicians during daily test stand and hangar operationsPerform real-time and post-test data review to evaluate the performance of test article and stand systems (fluid, structural, thermal, electrical). This includes documenting test results and recommending areas for upgrades and improvementFind innovative ways to create, review, and optimize test processesprocedures to increase testing capability and rateIdentify and characterize system pitfalls and potential hazards; then work to resolve these by collaborating with design, production, and launch engineers on improvements for flight hardware and processesServe as the final authority to ensure all operations are conducted in a safe mannerPerform other related duties, as assigned, for the purpose of ensuring an efficient and effective work environmentBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in mechanical engineering, aerospace engineering, electrical engineering or other engineering field1 years of hands-on testing experience (experience from internships, clubs or other hands-on extra-curricular activities qualifies)PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:3 years of hands on experience with mechanical systems, structural systems, propulsion systems, fluid systems, flight hardware or test operationsAbility to thrive in ambiguous requirements and aggressive timelinesHigh levels of personal autonomy and self-driven motivationKnowledge of hazardous systems (high pressure, cryogenic, flammable, hypergolic, pyrophoric)High level of familiarity with instrumentation and control (programmable logic control, high speed data acquisition, pressure transducers, thermocouples, RTDs, strain gauges, accelerometers, flow meters, load cells, relays, solenoid valves)Experience with code based data analytics (Python, R, MATLAB, NI LabVIEW) to solve real world problemsDemonstrated experience of effective root cause and failure analysisExperience writing and optimizing high risk technical procedures and work instructionsAbility to read, understand and apply technical manuals, data reports, mechanical schematics, electrical schematics, and design specificationsStrong interpersonal skills and ability to work effectively in a team environment, accomplishing tasks with limited resources at a rapid paceADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:Flight hardware is typically built in tight quarters and physical dexterity is requiredPhysical effort including sitting or standing for extended periods of time, lifting and carrying weight such as materials or equipment (up to 25 lbs. unassisted)Work performed in an environment with exposure to fumes, odors and noiseOccasionally exposed to work in extreme outdoor environments (heat, cold, rain)Hours vary depending on site operational needs; flexibility requiredCOMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:        Pay range:    Test EngineerLevel I: 95,000.00 - 115,000.00per year    Test EngineerLevel II: 110,000.00 - 130,000.00per year    Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX. You may also be eligible for long-term incentives, in the form of company stock, stock options, or long-term cash awards, as well as potential discretionary bonuses and the ability to purchase additional stock at a discount through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan. You will also receive access to comprehensive medical, vision, and dental coverage, access to a 401(k) retirement plan, short and long-term disability insurance, life insurance, paid parental leave, and various other discounts and perks. You may also accrue 3 weeks of paid vacation and will be eligible for 10 or more paid holidays per year. Exempt employees are eligible for 5 days of sick leave per year.
