About the role:
We are looking for an outstanding individual to join the Molecular Biology team as a Research Associate. The ideal candidate will have a proven track-record of developing innovative molecular biology protocols for solving complex biological problems. You should be driven by making great products and enjoy working in a fast-paced, innovative and truly multi-disciplinary environment. You will interact closely with colleagues in computational biology, software, chemistry and microfluidics, and apply your skills and knowledge to optimize and evaluate new assays in the area of spatial multi-omics.
 
What you will be doing:

Support the method development and optimization of novel molecular biology assay schemes for the detection of analytes in situ
Perform in situ assays on tissue sections on microscope glass slides
Participate in optimization and troubleshooting of different sample preparation protocols for improved detection of analytes in situ
High throughput fluorescent microscopy imaging of the processed tissue samples, and image data pre-processing
Plan and perform experiments, and analyze their subsequent data with minimal guidance
Maintain accurate records through diligent experimental observations and data tracking
Clearly communicate and present results; contribute data for making critical design decisions


To be successful in this role, you will need:
 

BSMS in molecular biology, biochemistry, cell biology, or a related field and 2 years of full-time, hands-on molecular biology experience in an academic or industrial setting
Proficient in standard molecular biology techniques such as sample preparation, nucleic acid amplification and purification (RNADNA), qPCR, and DNA sequencing
Experience in troubleshooting and optimization of molecular biology assays 
Light and fluorescent microscopy experience (confocal or standard epi-fluorescence)
Experience with experimental design and data analysis
Experience performing complex multi-step experiments with detailed and diligent attention to planning, organization, hands-on technique, and record keeping
Strong collaboration and communication skills

 
Additionally, wed like to see:

Familiarity with histology sample preparation
Tissue handling experience (fresh frozen, FFPE, cryo-sectioning, antigen retrieval, etc.)
Experience with different types of tissue specimen
Familiarity with Design of Experiments (DOE)
Familiarity with single cell transcriptomics and next generation sequencing library preparation workflows
