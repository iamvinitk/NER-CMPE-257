WHAT WE ARE LOOKING FORWhen you work at Momentum on the Experiential Production (XP) Team, every day is different.  While you will be assigned to a particular client, we ultimately work as a collective to support the production of experiential activations across all of our clients.  In addition to being exposed to multiple clients, you will work on a broad range of activations from mobile tours to major sponsorship activations to virtual experiences.  Like we said, every day is different, but thats what keeps it interesting. So, we are looking for team players with a strong work ethic and next level organizational skills who have the desire and ability to travel at a moments notice to produce events throughout the U.S.  The work isnt always glamorous, but there is nothing like the feeling of bringing events to life, especially now!
