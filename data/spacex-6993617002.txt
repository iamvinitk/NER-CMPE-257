SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.DSP SOFTWARE ENGINEER, COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS (STARSHIELD)Starshield leverages SpaceXs Starlink technology and launch capability to support national security efforts. While Starlink is designed for consumer and commercial use, Starshield is designed for government use, with an initial focus on earth observation, communications, and hosted payloads.As a DSP software engineer on the Starshield satellite team, you will be a part of a mission to provide global connectivity to the US government including immediate access to critical intelligence and national security data anywhere it is needed. You will work with a team of RF engineers, DSP engineers, software engineers, hardware engineers, and end users to design and build communications systems to provide essential data to global users. You will work in a highly collaborative and fast-paced environment, where we are exploring unsolved problems and applying the SpaceX mindset of iterating rapidly to go from design and demo to operational capability at lightning pace.An active Top Secret security clearance, or ability to obtain one, is desired.RESPONSIBILITIES:Write CC and python based software to implement Software Defined Radio (SDR) modemsDesign the complete physical layer waveform and implement the modem on space-based hardwareWork in close collaboration with FPGA, RFantenna, and software engineers to design and validate software-defined radio systemsCharacterize on-orbit system performance and drive continual design improvements to the software and hardware BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:1 years of experience in DSPsoftware engineering and Bachelors degree in computer science, computer engineering or electrical engineering; or 3 years of DSPsoftware engineering experience in lieu of a degree1 years of experience in software engineering using CC and Python1 years of experience in system-level modeling andor digital signal processingPREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:Masters degree in engineering with emphasis in Communication Systems andor Digital Signal ProcessingExperience working with various multiple access schemes such as TDMA, CDMA and OFDMAExperience with software-defined radios and frameworks, such as GNU RadioKnowledge of digital communication systems including spread spectrum, forward error correction, and modulation types such as FSK, BPSK, QPSK, QAM, and PCMFMKnowledge of typical communication channel effects like multi-path, Doppler, phase noise, AWGNKnowledge of Forward Error Correction (FEC) codes such as LDPC and Turbo CodesKnowledge of GPS, geolocation, position navigation and timing (PNT), and techniques such as TDOA, FDOA, and AOALOBUnderstanding of link budgets and analysis related to communication systemsUnderstanding of modem designs, link-level algorithms and hardware architecturesActive Top Secret, Top Secret SCI, OR ability and willingness to obtain a Top Secret clearance [is desired but not required]COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:    Pay Range:    DSP EngineerLevel I: 120,000.00 - 145,000.00per year    DSP EngineerLevel II: 140,000.00 - 170,000.00per year    Your actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX.
