The goal of the ML team at Scale is to develop machine learning solutions advancing the company mission. Our current focus areas are computer vision (2D3D detection, 2D3D segmentation, object tracking), meta-learning (e.g. semi-supervised learning, active learning), and Natural Language Processing. Youll be working on a combination of deeply technical ML applications in production and cutting edge research problems. Working at Scale will give you opportunities to work with our wide customer base which includes leading research teams and exposure to a wide range of problems within machine learning. 
We are building a large hybrid human-machine system in service of ML pipelines for dozens of industry-leading customers. Our machine learning models form the basis for Scales expansion and future product strategy. We currently complete billions of tasks a month, and will continue to grow to support more complex use cases and more advanced ML powered products.
 
Example Projects:

Research and develop machine learning solutions to assist humans in the loop
Aid in the creation of high quality ground truth data with speed and accuracy
Work with public Large Language models to benchmark and make custom versions for internal use cases
Take state of the art models developed internally and from the community, use them in production to solve problems for our customers and taskers
Take models currently in production, identify areas for improvement, improve them using retraining and hyperparameter searches, then deploy without regressing on core model characteristics
Work with product and research teams to identify opportunities for improvement in our current product line and for enabling upcoming product lines
Work with massive datasets to develop both generic models as well as fine tune models for specific products
