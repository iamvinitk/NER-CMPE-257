Mission Summary 
As part of the CORE (Compute  Onboard Runtime Environment) integration team you will be working to improve the reliability and performance of the Motional autonomous system. Our largest fleet is based in Las Vegas, and we are looking for individuals with a breadth of experience who are comfortable working in embedded systems, high performance C applications, and who also have a good grasp of the Linux operating system.
You will be working across the code base and across the various infrastructure and autonomy teams to do in depth root cause analysis of failures and performance issues in vehicles, and then work in the respective system to create a permanent resolution.
The team is responsible to make sure that our fleet continues to be operational, and to ensure that vehicle performance is improving. This job requires getting hands on with the vehicle compute platform, engaging in live debugging in the vehicle, and being comfortable working to fix complex pieces of software with teams from across multiple disciplines and time zones. In addition you will also be active developers on the Remote Vehicle Assistance program (teleoperations), expected to design, implement, and test new features to enable our Remote Vehicle Operators to resolve situations the AV cannot yet handle.
The Motional Las Vegas office is located less than 10 miles from the Las Vegas strip at 730 E Pilot Road, the Las Vegas office is home to one of the largest fleets of self-driving vehicles. The citys grid system of roads and being one of Americas smart cities allows for extensive research and development testing.
What Youll Be Doing:

Youll be directly contributing to the development of the Remote Vehicle Assistance, Real Time Infrastructure, and HIL Infrastructure.
Your expertise will help us debug real, live issues in the cars as they come up in the operation of our fleet.
Youll be collaborating across multiple disciplines and working with teams focused on embedded systems, the AV planning stack, perception, sensor data processing, and all of our in-car stack.

What Were Looking For:

Youre passionate about understanding how complex systems work
Youll work with cross-functional teams to perform root cause analysis to achieve robust issue resolution
Youre able to debug running, distributed systems
You have experience working on both x86 and embedded architectures (ARM, RISC)
Experience working on Linux operating system, especially network stack

Bonus Points (not required):

Experience working with real time sensor systems
Experience tuning Linux kernel for performance

Why you should join us:

This is a unique opportunity where you will be able to form the foundation for developing cutting edge algorithms on Motionals self driving vehicle platforms. All the while helping to drive strong engineering practices in the embedded software space.
