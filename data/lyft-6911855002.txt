At Lyft, our mission is to improve peoples lives with the worlds best transportation. To do this, we start with our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization.
The Developer Environments teams main objective is to build the best tools and platforms to enable Lyft developers to reliably and quickly test changes in a local  integrated environment. We also own mission critical testing platforms at Lyft that ensure that Lyft systems and architecture can handle the load of customer demand during peak events like New Years Eve, as well as catching defects in code before they reach production. Our systems are used Lyft-wide to test new features, catch regressions and generate traffic through a large scale ride simulator. Our teams work directly impacts how rapidly and successfully Lyft engineers can ship their features.
As a Staff Engineer on the Developer Environments team you will be responsible for delivering critical, large scoped projects that will be used by all the software engineers at Lyft. Using your experience, you will drive technical solutions that can help our engineers reliably test their code and identify resiliency gaps in the system well before it can have a customer impact. You will work cross functionally with product team stakeholders and other infrastructure leaders to formulate a roadmap and longer term vision for the team.
We are looking for candidates who are self starters and have a proven track record of delivering large scale software solutions that can solve critical business needs. The candidate should be able to dive deep into any problems with lots of ambiguity and build a technical solution to solve it. They should be willing to work closely with our product teams to gather requirements and take end to end ownership of projects  features and drive it from design to implementation. They should have experience mentoring junior engineers. Any team leadership experience is a plus.
