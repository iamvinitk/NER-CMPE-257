About the Company
At Torc, we have always believed that autonomous vehicle technology will transform how we travel, move freight, and do business.
A leader in autonomous driving since 2007, Torc has spent over a decade commercializing our solutions with experienced partners. Now a part of the Daimler family, we are focused solely on developing software for automated trucks to transform how the world moves freight.
Join us and catapult your career with the company that helped pioneer autonomous technology, and the first AV software company with the vision to partner directly with a truck manufacturer.Meet the Team: 
This team utilizes engineering, statistical, and programming skills to collect, analyze, and interpret large heterogenous data sets. They apply experience with vehicles, sensing hardware and autonomous driving systems. Also the team develops robust and transparent cloud-based, primarily serverless, data analysis pipelines that provide continuous feedback to the organization on safety performance. Collaborate with individuals from a variety of disciplines to understand their processes, integrate workflows, and generate analyses that support team level and executive level decision making.
What youll do: 

Proactively research and access internal and external big data sources; perform various levels of exploratory analyses to evaluate internal variable completeness and relevance; investigate, learn and apply tools of new domains; integrate data across disparate domains and data types. 
Develop cloud-based, primarily serverless, workflows to transform raw data; integrate and preprocess data from a variety of domains (sensing, physics, video, meteorological, geospatial, content analysis, etc.).
Work within a variety of database architectures to retrieve and store data.
Apply physicsengineering principals and formulae to appropriately transform and filter raw data; apply knowledge of statistics to characterize uniformity, accuracy, outliers.
Use an iterative method of data pre-processing, interactive visualization, and sharing of intermediate results to solicit early and ongoing guidance and buy-in from a variety of stakeholders.
Identify and select appropriate analyses methods for data ranging in scale from dense to sparse.
Apply statistical principals to manage bias and select appropriate sampling strategies.
Develop models and compares using statistical performance metrics.
Appropriately and transparently down selects factors to enable teams and stakeholders to focus on those that are having the largest impact on performance.
Construct continuous analysis workflows to support day-to-day operations, gateway decision making, and event response.
Use visualization software and interactive output to support others in understanding analyses and decision making.
Translate methods and findings into clear and concise documentation.
Automate text base reporting, where appropriate, for efficiency and to support generation of necessary regulatory artifacts.
Document code, workflows, and persistent data stores to facilitate reference and use by others within the organization.
