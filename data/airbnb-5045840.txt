Airbnb was born in 2007 when two Hosts welcomed three guests to their San Francisco home, and has since grown to over 4 million Hosts who have welcomed more than 1 billion guest arrivals in almost every country across the globe. Every day, Hosts offer unique stays and experiences that make it possible for guests to connect with communities in a more authentic way.The Community You Will Join: 
The Storage Foundation team within Airbnbs Storage Infra org owns Airbnbs online serving storage system. The group is responsible for designing, building and operating the software and solutions listed below.

This will also serve as the unified storage backend for Airbnb Infrastructure.
A set of managed storage services  APIs built on top of the unified backend, e.g.:

A highly available, low-latency, distributed, multi-tenant KV storage layer for Airbnb user profiling, Search, ML, pricing teams, supporting million-level read QPS, 99.9 availability across thousands of customer tables.
Design and deliver a new paved path for online Graph Store that would serve as a source-of-truth Graph database, as well as a low-latency, highly available querying engine powering Airbnbs Knowledge and Social Graph.

A set of control planes and provisioning managements for OpenSearch and ElasticCache for hundreds of Airbnb production clusters, at million IOPS and million indexing QPS.
