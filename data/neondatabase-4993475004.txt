Neon is a multi-cloud Serverless Postgres provider that is designed to make Postgres developers more productive in the cloud. We manage clusters, storage, and compute automatically, so all you need to do is connect and develop. We have separated compute and storage so they can scale independently. This keeps costs low during development and makes it easy to deploy into production. Our scale-to-zero pricing means if your database is not being used, your credit card doesnt get refused.
With a generous free tier, this is already the database you want for your next project. Now add database branching, which means instantaneous copying of any database at any point in its life cycle, and you have a Postgres that is ready for modern development workflows.
