About the team 
Before Stripe, every growing internet platform had a payments team. Today, every growing internet platform has an Identity team. Stripe Identity is building a service that enables merchants to seamlessly verify their customers while scaling globally with ease. We believe Identity is a core piece of economic infrastructure for online businesses, just like payments. 
Great Identity solutions not only enable complex, highly regulated businesses to work with ease on the internet, but they also effectively keep merchants and consumers in the internet economy. Stripe Identitys mission is to become the easiest way to verify a real-world identity on the internet.
