The Rule Enforcement team is dedicated to keeping all employees in line.  Rule enforcers use various tactics such as physical intimidation, awkward pauses, and dramatic coffee sips in order to make sure everyone does what theyre told.
As a Good Cop, youll work closely with Bad Cops in order to extract information from employees. Dont let the name of the role fool you however -- you are going to be just as bad as Bad Cops, but youll preferably have experience playing the part of the kind, compassionate and fair cop.
