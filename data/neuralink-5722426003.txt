Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.Team Description:
Join the Materials Engineering team at Neuralink and be part of an elite and diverse team of materials engineers, chemists, and device engineers working on high-performance, biocompatible materials for next-generation brain-computer interfaces. We are looking for a hands-on materials engineer for the management and execution of materials characterization and testing experiments using in-house instrumentation. You will be an integral member of a small, fast-moving team. We also work closely with mechanical engineers and microfabrication experts for system integration and packaging solutions.
Job Responsibilities:
The Materials Intern will focus on testing materials using a range of characterization and accelerated aging techniques to improve device reliability and longevity. You will manage and execute experiments using characterization and testing platforms to determine the root-cause failure modes of medical devices. This will involve instruments such as dynamic mechanical analyzers, electrochemical probe stations, etc. You will also be involved with various cross-team efforts to build high-throughput testing equipment for evaluating yield and longevity. For example, use-case accelerated aging testing, mechanical fatigue, etc.
You will be contributing to the development of high density, reliable neural interfaces that are at the ground level of brain-computer-interfaces. This is a unique opportunity to work closely in a multi-disciplinary team and in an environment where you have direct impact on the next-gen product.
About You:

You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.
You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.
You are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software, mechanical, electrical, materials, biological engineers, and neuroscientists. You are comfortable communicating across teams.
Resourceful, flexible and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.

Key Qualifications:

Experience with the standard mechanical testing equipment (tensile tester, DMA, etc), user interfaces and familiarity with associated test standards (ASTM, etc)
Experience with mechanical design (Solidworks, etc)
Familiarity with the scientific principles involved in analyzing mechanical tests
2 years of hands-on experience with mechanical testing.

Preferred qualifications:

Experience with DMA, TMA, andor other mechanical related testing equipment
Experience with instrument operational software in addition to hardware for mechanical testing equipment
Familiarity with failure analysis and mechanical modeling methods (i.e. FEA, COMSOL)
Experience troubleshooting lab instrumentation for mechanical, electrochemical analysis.
