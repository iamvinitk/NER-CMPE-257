Parallel Systems is a Series A startup company developing the future of intermodal transportation. Our mission is to decarbonize freight while improving supply chain logistics and safety. We are developing vehicles and software to create new autonomous and electric transportation systems for existing rail infrastructure.
At Parallel Systems, we value the team as much as the mission. We want to work with talented people who are humble, motivated, and persistent. Our most successful team members are self-starters and collaborate with others to reach our collective goals.
Were looking for a talented Senior Mechanical Engineers to architect the vehicle, design components, and test the system in Downtown Los Angeles. In this role, youll work with fellow engineers and technicians to bring up new designs in our lab and run vehicles on our dedicated test track just outside the city. This is an opportunity to engage early with new designs, making a huge impact on the direction of the technology. Ideal candidates would be building on strong first principles and engineering skills and have a desire to expand their responsibilities to own hardware designs.
 

Responsibilities 

Work closely with multi-disciplinary engineering teams. Derive architecture, meet and present technical direction, build consensus
Execute on all phases of hardware development including requirements capture, prototyping, design validation, and manufacturing readiness
Design system block diagrams, schematics, select components, and layout PCBAs. Conduct worst-case circuit analysis in support of safety critical hardware
Create and execute design of experiments for decisions on architecture, component selection, and manufacturing processes as necessary.
Support manufacturing, vehicle integration, and validation

Basic Qualifications

BS in Mechanical Engineering or similar Engineering discipline
3 years of professional or project experience in hardware development, machine design, or validation
Mechanical Engineering skills including: drawing creation and GDT, structural analysis, selection of materials and processes, understanding of failure mechanisms, and analyticalscientific programming (i.e. Python, Matlab, Simulink, Excel)
Experience with at least one commercial CAD tool (Solidworks, Fusion 360, etc)
Experience with at least one commercial FEA or multi-physics simulation package (i.e. Simulink, Solidworks, NASTRAN, ABAQUS, ANSYS)
