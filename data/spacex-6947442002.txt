At SpaceX, we are revolutionizing space technology and pushing the boundaries of what is possible. As a Sr. Turbomachinery Engineer, you will play a critical role in designing and developing the next generation of turbopumps for our Raptor engine, the propulsion system that will take us to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.
SR. TURBOMACHINERY ENGINEER (RAPTOR)
SpaceX is seeking a highly motivated Sr. Turbomachinery Engineer to join our team in designing and developing the next generation of turbopumps for Raptor. You will lead the design, development, and qualification of rocket turbopumps for multiple applications at SpaceX, taking the designs from initial concept to flight.  Conduct coupled aerodynamichydrodynamic and mechanical design and demonstrate a broad turbomachinery system understanding as well as the ability to work with a wider team of specialists in the various sub-systems. Ensure that turbomachinery solutions are developed to meet challenging manufacturing goals, minimum costweight, and on an aggressive schedule. 
RESPONSIBILITIES: 

Design, build, and testâ€¯turbopumps for liquid-fueled rocket engines and other rocket or spacecraft systems
Own critical turbomachinery components and be responsible for every aspect of the turbomachinery design, demonstrate ownership and work in close collaboration with manufacturing and assembling
Perform the hydrodynamic sizing and flowpath design and analysis work for impellers and diffusers for the raptor engine and other turbomachinery for spacecraft systems 
Ensure that detailed mechanical analysis is performed on all the turbopump componentssystems. Review drawings and make sure that selected designs meet the required standards for life and reliability targets
Devise accurate and correct models, develop new methodologies and first principles-based tools to determine turbopump performance and operability. Push the boundary of the state of the art of turbomachinery designs by exploring innovative concepts
Interface with our world-class production team to ensure designs are successfully translated into flight hardware that is revolutionizing access to space
Work with teams developing other systems (vehicle, feedlines, valves, etc.) to ensure that the turbopump design is optimally integrated and that risks are well balanced across the system
Own secondary flow analysis and design, ensure that current and future hardware meets performance targets
Support both component and assembly testing. Be involved with defining the test configuration, the test processexecution and review the results to confirm
Lead the resolution of issues encountered with the turbopump during developmentqualification testing
Support ongoing design improvements to turbopump assemblies andor sub systems including manufacturing improvements to reduce cost and lead time of components
