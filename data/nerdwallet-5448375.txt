Customer focus. Use your deep understanding of how to connect data across multiple organizations and user experiences in order to consolidate the view of a customer and then leverage that consolidated view to enhance the user experience even further.  
Build cross-functional partnerships. You work with individuals across NerdWallet to ensure your teams align on business strategy and deliver on commitments. You work closely with product managers and program managers to maximize the success of your projects.
