P-150
At Databricks, we are obsessed with enabling data teams to solve the worlds toughest problems, from security threat detection to cancer drug development. We do this by building and running the worlds best data and AI infrastructure platform, so our customers can focus on the high value challenges that are central to their own missions.
Founded in 2013 by the original creators of Apache Spark, Databricks has grown from a tiny corner office in Berkeley, California to a global organization with over 1000 employees. Thousands of organizations, from small to Fortune 100, trust Databricks with their mission-critical workloads, making us one of the fastest growing SaaS companies in the world.
Our engineering teams build highly technical products that fulfill real, important needs in the world. We constantly push the boundaries of data and AI technology, while simultaneously operating with the resilience, security and scale that is critical to making customers successful on our platform.
We develop and operate one of the largest scale software platforms. The fleet consists of millions of virtual machines, generating terabytes of logs and processing exabytes of data per day. At our scale, we regularly observe cloud hardware, network, and operating system faults, and our software must gracefully shield our customers from any of the above.
As a software engineer with a backend focus, you will work closely with your team and product management to prioritize, design, implement, test, and operate micro-services for the Databricks platform and product. This implies, among others, writing software in ScalaJava, building data pipelines (Apache Spark, Apache Kafka), integrating with third-party applications, and interacting with cloud APIs (AWS, Azure, CloudFormation, Terraform).
Below are some example teams you can join:
Data Science and Machine Learning Infrastructure: Build services and infrastructure at the intersection of machine learning and distributed systems. Our technology empowers the flagship collaborative workspace, notebooks, IDE integrations, and project management products. We also enable machine learning at scale with tools for environment management, distributed training, and managing the Machine Learning lifecycle through MLflow.
