About the Company
At Torc, we have always believed that autonomous vehicle technology will transform how we travel, move freight, and do business.
A leader in autonomous driving since 2007, Torc has spent over a decade commercializing our solutions with experienced partners. Now a part of the Daimler family, we are focused solely on developing software for automated trucks to transform how the world moves freight.
Join us and catapult your career with the company that helped pioneer autonomous technology, and the first AV software company with the vision to partner directly with a truck manufacturer.What youll do:  
You will support the perception simulation pipeline of our autonomous trucks in a virtual testing environment. In this role, you will be responsible for supporting our software, systems, and release teams in the execution of virtual testing of Torcs software components and integrated autonomous driving systems. You will also provide support to Torcs development and integration teams and be instrumental in growing the robustness and safety of our self-driving technology.  

Advance modern simulation techniques by using state-of-the art ML approaches and computer vision techniques 
Enhance the perception sensor simulation environment with modern augmentation and ML methods to overcome the domain gap between real world data and synthetic simulation data 
Support designing and implementing a neural rendering framework that allows to scale perception simulation 
Integrate the framework in a cloud environment and automize the pipeline to allow scaling for the target verification and validation of our autonomous trucks 
Identify and apply appropriate virtual testing technologies and methodologies for a given perception component or system-level testing effort 
Identify testing gaps and derive requirements for new or improved test tools, perception simulation environments and test frameworks  

What youll need to Succeed:  

BS, MS or PhD in computer vision, machine learning, computer science, computer engineering or related fields 
5 years of software development experience or a PhD in machine learning, Computer Vision, or related field 
Strong experience in Python and science libraries like Numpy, SciPy, Pandas and Matplotlib 
Experience with one or more deep learning framework such as PyTorch or TensorFlow 
Expert knowledge of the principles, algorithms and tools of applied Deep Learning, including model training strategies, data processing, cost functions, quality metrics, etc. 
Experience with 3D Computer Vision or rendering algorithms 
Experience in applying machine learning towards rendering, 3D computer vision or related field, preferably multiple projects in these core areas 
Track record of successfully building and shipping products or open source projects 
Working knowledge of Test-Driven Development Methodology and test framework architectures 

Bonus Points!  

Publication record in Computer Vision, Computer Graphics and Machine Learning conferences (e.g. SIGGRAPH, CVPR, NeurIPS, ICCV, ICLR, ICML ...) is a plus 
Kanban, Scrum or Scaled Agile development 
Experience developing sensor models, 3D simulation environments, rendering and ray tracing in a perception simulation environment (i.e., game engine or other similar simulation environment) 
Software and system troubleshooting and problem-solving with specific focus on system-level analysis, fault isolation and identification 
Automotive or similar test and validation 
Technical leadership experience 
Experiences with Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulation and testing methodologies 
Experience with C, C, ROS for autonomous SW development and simulation tooling
