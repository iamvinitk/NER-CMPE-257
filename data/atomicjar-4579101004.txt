AtomicJar just announced a 25M Series A round of funding and is poised for fast growth. The company is on a mission to make developers more productive, the software they write more resilient and the organizations they work for more agile. We empower developers to create effective, automated and incredibly fast integration tests that shift testing into the flow of the development cycle which allows issues to be discovered, fixed and released much more rapidly.
AtomicJar is a well-funded, remote-first, early stage startup with an inclusive and rapidly growing global team. The explosive growth of the Testcontainers, which has surpassed 100M downloads and our recently closed funding round, will accelerate development and adoption of Testcontainers Cloud.  Testcontainers has transformed test-enabled development at leading engineering organizations like DoorDash, Spotify, Uber, Google, Zalando, RedHat, CapitalOne, many more, becoming the de facto standard for dev-first testing with our Cloud product set to supercharge testing pipelines. Business Insider recently named us as one of the 43 Enterprise-Tech Startups to Bet Your Career on in 2022.
