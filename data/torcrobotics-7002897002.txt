About the Company
At Torc, we have always believed that autonomous vehicle technology will transform how we travel, move freight, and do business.
A leader in autonomous driving since 2007, Torc has spent over a decade commercializing our solutions with experienced partners. Now a part of the Daimler family, we are focused solely on developing software for automated trucks to transform how the world moves freight.
Join us and catapult your career with the company that helped pioneer autonomous technology, and the first AV software company with the vision to partner directly with a truck manufacturer.Meet the team:   
In the Training and Metrics group our core obligation is to develop and own the production-grade automated processes of the perception data loop. Starting with data selection, following training, evaluation and deployment, in the end, our machine learning models make our trucks perceive the world! We enable automated, data driven iteration cycles on the perception machine learning stack. To be successful, we collaborate with different perception teams, as well as Data Science and ML Ops teams across the company.  
What youll do:   

Implement and integrate the production grade deep learning trainings, evaluation and model conversion of the perception machine learning stack (pytorch, AWS, Kubernetes)  
Accelerate the optimization of the perception training  evaluation  conversion pipelines regarding runtime, memory consumption and network usage  
Integrate training monitoring tools and ensure compatibility of training results and training data with other internal services  
Supervise the unification process of common platform, developer and pipeline tooling such as data loading, model conversion for embedded hardware and evaluation processes and common data formats  
Coordinate and negotiate the development of shared, modular neural network architectures between multiple perception teams    

What youll need to succeed:  

Masters degree in computer science, data science, artificial intelligence or related field  
Knowledge and application experience of deploying Software Engineering best practices like coding standards, formatting and test-driven development  
2 years of relevant professional experience in the field of MLOps 
2 years of experience with python and PyTorch in a distributed  multi-GPU setting, ideally on AWS  
Experience in working within ML automation, data loop and deploying continuous trainings  
Excellent coordination and ability to communicate highly technical topics   

Bonus points!
