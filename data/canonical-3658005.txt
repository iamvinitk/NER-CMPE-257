Canonical is hiring a Python Software Engineer to join the Certification team, who make the tools which enable us to know that a desktop, laptop, server or IoT device is working properly. We work at the interface of hardware and software, so the ideal candidate is a Python developer familiar with hardware.
The Certification team develops the tools needed to certify hardware as working with Ubuntu Core as well as Ubuntu Desktop and Server: https:ubuntu.comcertified
We design hardware which can be used to probe devices independently, and frameworks for software tests that check every aspect of Ubuntu on that hardware.
This is an excellent opportunity for someone who wants to have a meaningful impact for adoption of Linux across multiple device categories and industries. Canonical offers a fun, fast-paced team environment and a career full of learning and development opportunities. This team is centered in EMEA time zones, and works with colleagues on related teams in both the Americas and APAC.
We work together with silicon companies, OEMs, ODMs and teams within Canonical to ensure a smooth, secure out of the box Ubuntu experience, with success in this role leading to a great Ubuntu experience being offered on more and more devices.
