About You
 
The L1 TSE candidate comes with a successful track record of using strong technical expertise in the cybersecurity domain of a fast-paced, enterprise SaaS company to provide world-class, 24 x 7 globally available product support.  Although relatively early in their career, with 2 years relevant experience, they must have already shown the ability to effectively communicate with security professionals (e.g., SOC Analysts and management) and earn both industry and team-leading results for support case intake, along with response, update, and resolution SLA attainment.
 
They should be passionate about helping customers in their time of need by going above and beyond in their craft.  This means detailed, timely, context-based responses to questions and reported issues that are tracked closely until full resolution and satisfaction is acknowledged by the customer. 
 
They should also be adept at evaluating top themes across assigned tickets to help prioritize fixes with the biggest impact to decrease ticket load and improve CX across our client base.
