Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.Team info:
The robotics and surgery engineering team is responsible for making sure Neuralinks various implanted devices get installed safely and efficiently in our customers.  This means our job as a team is not limited just to the insertion of the implants electrodes, but instead is to own the full parking lot to parking lot experience of a potential Neuralink customer in a way that scales.  We started by focusing on electrode implantation, but for Neuralink devices to help the millions we hope it can, the entire experience of getting Neuralink devices must be safe, quick, and non-traumatic.  While we use the parking lot to parking lot idiom, this actually includes everything from pre-screening, to the design and building of vertically integrated clinics, to the actual day-of experience of getting our devices (pre-op, op, and post-op). We are responsible for all of this!
