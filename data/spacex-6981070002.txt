SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal ofâ€¯enabling human life on Mars.
GNC ENGINEER, STARLINK DISH
At SpaceX were leveraging our experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy Starlink, the worlds most advanced broadband internet system. Starlink is the worlds largest satellite constellation and is providing fast, reliable internet to 2M users worldwide. We design, build, test, and operate all parts of the system  thousands of satellites, consumer receivers that allow users to connect within minutes of unboxing, and the software that brings it all together. Weve only begun to scratch the surface of Starlinks potential global impact and are looking for best-in-class engineers to help maximize Starlinks utility for communities and businesses around the globe.
As an engineer on this team, you will bring a passion and expertise in areas like control theory, state estimation, orbital mechanics, spacecraft systems design, optimization, and software development to join the Starlink guidance, navigation, and control (GNC). Come help us write the autopilot algorithms for thousands of satellites (the worlds largest constellation!) and more than one million user terminals, enabling access to high speed broadband internet in all corners of the world.
RESPONSIBILITIES:

Design and analysis of GNC logic for consumer and enterprise Starlink phased array antennas.

Real-time angular and translational navigation using onboard sensors and optimal state estimation techniques.
Design of beam-steering logic to track and hand-off satellites while maximizing link integrity in challenging operational environments.


Develop features which will enable Starlink to be deployed in a variety of new applications, including ships, aircraft, spacecraft, and more.
Provide engineering and data review support for hardware development, special projects, and customer support triage.
Work with hardware engineers on the design and specification of future user terminal products and their navigation sensor packages.
Model derivation and high fidelity simulation for development and validation of prototype features.
Implementation, validation, unit testing, and deployment of production software (C) pertinent to the systems described above.
