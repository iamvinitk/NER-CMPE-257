Company Description:
We are creating the future of brain-computer interfaces: building devices now that have the potential to help people with paralysis regain mobility and independence and invent new technologies that could expand our abilities, our community, and our world.Team Description:
The Next Gen team at Neuralink is developing the next generation of brain-computer interfaces. We are laying the groundwork for intuitive, high-dimensional, and bidirectional interfaces between brains and machines, with the goal of helping people challenged by a variety of neurological disorders and conditions. Our team consists of scientists and engineers, working closely together to define the engineering requirements for these future products. As a neuroengineer on this team you will contribute across a wide range of projects, from designing novel experimental preparations, to interpreting neural signals and behavioral data, to developing novel BCI paradigms. Successful candidates will be highly adaptable, able to deploy their core technical and creative skills to tackle a wide range of problems, and have a keen sense of urgency.
Job Responsibilities and Description:

Design, execute, interpret, and communicate the results of experiments
Develop decoding models for novel brain-computer interfaces
Develop encoding strategies for large scale sensory neural stimulation
Present results in a collaborative setting
Run and support research sessions in coordination with software engineers and animal training specialists

About You:

You find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them
You deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a solution that works every time
