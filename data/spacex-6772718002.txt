SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.RADIATION EFFECTS ENGINEERAs a member of our fast-paced Radiation Effects team, you will be responsible for ensuring avionics hardware performance across our fleet of vehicles (Dragon, Falcon, Starship, Lunar Human Landing System, etc.) through some of the harshest and varied radiation environments imaginable. In order to ensure maximum reliability in an ionizing radiation environment, the Radiation team at SpaceX performs exhaustive analysis, design, and test at the component, board, unit and subsystem levels with extensive opportunity to interact with a vast array of rocket and spacecraft hardware and electronics. As one of the few teams required to interface with the design, manufacturing, integration, and mission operations teams, we play a critical role in the development of our systems as we advance our efforts towards broadband satellite internet and safe, reliable, inexpensive, and innovative access to space with the fundamental goal of expanding human space exploration capabilities and establishing a permanent human presence on the Moon and Mars.RESPONSIBILITIES: Support a cross-discipline team of design and system engineers, while providing radiation test and analysis results, advice on requirements flow down, modeling and analysis reports, and recommendations for mitigating radiation effectsDevelop and debug complex test designsPrepare and fully execute test plans and analysis for single event effect, total ionizing dose, and displacement damage dosePerform testing to characterize parts and assemblies for their total ionizing dose and single event effect (protons and heavier ions) sensitivitiesDevelop design requirements based on use case (environment and system reliability requirements)Make recommendations for design, process improvements, and data collectionPerform root-cause analysis of test failures and communicate recommended actionsEstablish requirements for component procurement specificationsBASIC QUALIFICATIONS:Bachelors degree in electrical engineering or physicsExperience programming in PythonPREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:1 years of experience in the radiation effects fieldPrevious work experience in radiation effects including modeling, testing, andor analysisStrong skills in mathematics and statisticsExcellent written and verbal communication skillsExperience in design andor analysis of digital and analog circuitsAbility to identify failures in radiation testing and knowledge on how to mitigate common failure mechanisms induced by ionizing radiationExperience with systems requiring resistance to ionizing dose including total ionizing dose testing, analysis to predict dose on orbit and familiarity with common problems and vulnerabilities to total ionizing doseExperience developing tests for microprocessors, ASICs, or FPGAsExperience with testing RF or optical interface devicesComputational experience in programming languages: CC, SQLFamiliarity and comfort with avionics hardware spanning integrated circuits, PCBA boards, sensorstransducers, functional troubleshooting and defect detectionFamiliarity and comfort with hardware blueprintsschematics and circuit functions based on designsKnowledgeexperience in the effects of UV and atomic oxygen on materials and componentsSuperior organizational and analytical skills with keen attention to detail and qualityRadiation dose safety training COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS:Pay Range:Radiation Effects Engineer Level I: 100,000.00 - 120,000.00per yearRadiation Effects Engineer Level II: 115,000.00 - 135,000.00per yearYour actual level and base salary will be determined on a case-by-case basis and may vary based on the following considerations: job-related knowledge and skills, education, and experience.Base salary is just one part of your total rewards package at SpaceX. You may also be eligible for long-term incentives, in the form of company stock, stock options, or long-term cash awards, as well as potential discretionary bonuses and the ability to purchase additional stock at a discount through an Employee Stock Purchase Plan.
