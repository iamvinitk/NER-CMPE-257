We partner with teams across the company to improve the profitability, scalability, and defensibility of our business model. We’re looking to hire strategic thinkers who can model the future, solve complex problems, and collaborate effectively to help carry projects from conception through execution.\nAbout the Role\nYou will serve as finance lead for our Grocery business, which is one of the fastest growing new categories on our marketplace.  Expansion into new categories is central to our growth strategy as a company, by creating entirely new use cases for customers and expanding our brand beyond restaurant delivery.  You’ll join as a senior leader on a lean but high horsepower team, and will be responsible for growing and cementing Grocery as one of the next pillars of our marketplace business, while simultaneously developing the team around you.  The person in this role will operate much like the CFO of a smaller start-up, owning a diverse set of finance responsibilities without clear boundaries, and helping to build the foundation of these businesses from the ground up.  \nIn this role you will:\n\nWork with GMs and product leaders to size opportunities and make strategic decisions and investments\nOversee financial reporting and forecasting, and ensure we have a clear and detailed understanding of the drivers of growth, margin expansion and competitive positioning\nHold cross-functional partners accountable to their financial plan and outcomes, and work with them to get things back on track if they miss\nMentor and develop new & existing talent to help them achieve their professional goals and scale our team as we continue to grow\nAdvise our executive team on ways to invest our resources more efficiently, to move faster and do more\nBuild models and develop analytical frameworks to evaluate new partnership opportunities, understand ROI / payback of various initiatives, and forecast demand more accurately, just to name a few\nEnsure we have necessary processes, systems and tools in place to streamline our operations and help us scale as quickly as possible\n\nThis is a unique opportunity for a highly motivated leader to exert real influence on the direction of our company, and help build a new business that’s still in its infancy.  We hope you’re as excited about it as we are.  \nYou’re excited about this opportunity because you will…\n\nProvide full financial oversight and leadership for our Grocery business, and directly influence strategy on how we grow and develop this new category on our marketplace while balancing economic constraints\nCollaborate with colleagues and cross-functional partners to develop and own new processes to drive financial clarity, identify opportunities, and measure risks in our business\nPour over mountains of data in search of meaningful insights, distill them into actionable recommendations, and work with others to convert them into tangible results\nSupport planning processes and special projects to improve, scale, and automate forecasting and reporting\nGain a deeper understanding of how to grow a new business within an established company, and operate one at scale\n\nWe’re excited about you because you…\n\nHave 8+ years of strategic finance, operational finance, FP&A, or investment banking experience at a high-growth technology startup or well-established company\nHave 3+ years of team management experience. Building and developing a team is something you are passionate about\nHave experience owning budgets for major functional areas within an organization, and working with operators on day-to-day execution to hit targets\nThrive in high-performance cultures, handle stress well, and aren’t afraid of long hours in pursuit of meaningful work\nEmbrace ambiguity. Rapid change and learning is exciting to you, and you know how to find direction and craft a plan of action even when none is given to you\nLead by example and indirect influence. You excel at navigating a rapidly growing organization with many different cross-functional partners, gaining input and building consensus with key stakeholders as you go.  You know how to organize and motivate a broad, diverse and geographically dispersed working team around a shared goal.\nAre relentless. Things never quite go according to plan. You have the determination and grit to keep working on a problem as new challenges emerge, while maintaining the flexibility to adjust plans or strategies as needed.\nHave a proven ability to earn the trust of senior leaders, and influence their thinking on key strategic decisions\nHave experience building and reviewing highly complex models, and developing a team that sets the gold standard for financial modeling.  You know how to distill complex financial data into digestible outputs and analyses, for use across the organization\nAre equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You don’t hesitate to get in the weeds and work at the lowest level of detail, but you’re just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.\nHave a demonstrated interest in logistics, on-demand services, marketplaces and grocery (nice to have)\n\nAbout DoorDash\nAt DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers.
