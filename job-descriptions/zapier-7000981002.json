This isn't your first rodeo. You have at least two years of experience managing teams of Backend Engineers. You know how to hire, train, and develop engineers from all backgrounds. You understand the benefits of building a diverse and inclusive engineering team. You may not have hired or managed hundreds of people before, but you have hired, trained, and managed at least a few engineers before.\nYou’re a product thinker. As an Engineering Manager, you’ve worked to set goals, metrics, and a strategy for a product-focused Engineering team. You push your team to prioritize impactful work to meet the company’s goals.You can keep track of, prioritize, and lead multiple projects. We're a small team, and there's no shortage of things you could be doing in a day. You'll carve out time for functional projects and make sure they solve real problems the team faces -- ideally making development even easier.\nYou have excellent communication skills. You regularly work with engineers and other stakeholders from various disciplines, balancing engineering concerns, such as technical debt, with product concerns. Ideally, you find solutions that address both the team and user needs but if not, help build understanding around difficult decisions.\nYou are a skilled engineering leader. You've got a strong background in leading a team of Engineers working in our stack (Python, Django or React, ES6 or Node.js, etc.).  Even if you aren't a daily coder, you regularly exercise your coding muscles and try to be an asset on any technical context your team may need.\nYou're adaptable. You've been in fast growing companies and know how to build, change, and adapt to the needs of a company as it grows.\n\n \nThings You'll Do\n\nWork closely with your engineering function and peer design function and product function to create a trio that tackles user problems and solutions.\nDevelop effective ways to communicate, monitor, and lead your team through weekly one-on-one’s and team meetings.\nKeep the leadership team informed on your team’s progress in ways that are easy and enjoyable to receive, like one-on-one's, update posts, and regular team hangouts.\nBuild rapport with each member of the Engineering Team and support them through coaching and mentorship to help level up their skills.\nParticipate in code reviews, learning and spreading technical knowledge throughout Zapier -- moving knowledge to documentation where appropriate.\nOccasionally dive into the code; fixing bugs, improving developer experience, smoothing edges -- sometimes even spiking out small proofs of concept.\nCollaborate across various disciplines (Product Managers, Designers, Researchers) to help set technical roadmaps that will achieve business goals through engineering best practices.\nActively recruit, onboard, and train new engineers at Zapier. This might involve tweaking the skills portions of interviews, or writing better documentation.\n\n \nZapier Compensation Guiding Principles\nWe believe all Zapiens should be rewarded competitively and equitably, using practices that are simple and transparent.
