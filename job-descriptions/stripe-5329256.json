Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nCollecting and filing sales & indirect taxes is a classic area for technology disruption. Companies selling across countries, states, and even smaller jurisdictions have to navigate through a myriad of tax rates, product-level tax exemptions, filing requirements, and registration obligations. The rules are constantly changing, and not accurately calculating and filing tax can have legal ramifications.  \nIt’s no surprise then that solving for tax compliance is a top customer ask. We launched Stripe Tax as a new SaaS product in 2021 to help solve this pain-point and make tax compliance as effortless as possible. It’s still early days, and we’re looking for strong product managers to help shape our product and build our business. \n \nWhat you’ll do\nResponsibilities\nAs a Product Manager on the new Stripe Tax Filing team, you’ll develop and bring to market a new product for Stripe. You will create intuitive user-facing experiences to solve a complex user problem.

You’ll also own key business metrics, and lead a team of strong engineering, design, product marketing, and data science partners to drive product adoption and growth.\nOur ideal Product Manager has an uncommonly discerning design sense while also being deeply analytical; they pair the two skills to find opportunities to power Stripe Tax’s growth while delighting our users. They are known to make things happen quickly, and are influential across product teams.\n \nWho you are\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply.
