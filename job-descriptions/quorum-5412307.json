You have an inquisitive mind and are self-motivated to learn and improve both yourself and the functions you support.\nYou possess a positive solutions-oriented approach to solving challenges that come up working in a dynamic environment. \nYou have experience working within an Agile environment. \n\nAbout the Sales Operations Team\n\nWe take pride in keeping the metaphorical train on its track at a high-growth start-up.\nWe believe that precedent is not best practice—we are constantly striving to improve our own workflow.
