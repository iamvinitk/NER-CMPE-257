New Verticals encompasses services like Retail, Convenience, Grocery, Alcohol delivery and more!\nAbout the Role\nWe are hiring two Managers to help us build and scale our Retail and Convenience businesses. You will lead the strategy development and implementation of growth and quality initiatives. In either of these roles, you might have the opportunity to work on consumer growth, merchant excellence, quality improvements and expansion efforts. You will report into a Senior Manager on our New Verticals Strategy & Operations team. We are currently operating in a hybrid model, some time in-office and some time remote but it is quite flexible! \nYou’re excited about this opportunity because you will…\n\nBuild. You’ll have your fingerprints all over DoorDash’s next big business. You’ll do whatever it takes to launch, get 1% better every day, and scale something completely new. This means everything from high-level strategy to nitty-gritty operational details.\nStrategize. From first principles, you’ll develop the optimal strategy for best serving our customers. \nExperiment. You’ll transform strategies into operational experiments that create measurable and actionable outcomes, informing your larger initiative implementation plans.\nAnalyze. You’ll assess the operational and financial impacts of your decisions, and iterate based on data.\nLead and collaborate. You’ll work with a cross-functional team, including marketing, design, product, and operations to build this new line of business for DoorDash.\n\nWe’re excited about you because…\n\nYou solve problems from first principles. You’re excited to solve problems in innovative ways, and you resist “this is how it’s always been done” thinking.\nYou’re equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You don’t hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but you’re just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team. No job is beneath you.\nYou’re unafraid of ambiguity. Rapid change and learning is exciting to you, and you thrive in ambiguous, startup environments\nYou’re analytical. You let data win arguments, and you’re comfortable pulling your own data in SQL or modeling in Excel.\nYou have 6-8+ years of experience. You’ve succeeded in high-performance cultures (whether in tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, or a related experience).\n\nAbout DoorDash\nAt DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods. DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nWe’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities. That’s why we hire and cultivate diverse teams of people from all backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. We believe that true innovation happens when everyone has room at the table and the tools, resources, and opportunity to excel.\nStatement of Non-Discrimination: In keeping with our beliefs and goals, no employee or applicant will face discrimination or harassment based on: race, color, ancestry, national origin, religion, age, gender, marital/domestic partner status, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, disability status, or veteran status.
