As we continue to scale our product and grow our team, we’re looking for an experienced Site Reliability Engineer to help drive automation, performance, and reliability in our cloud-based infrastructure.\nLocation: This role is remote; however, we're specifically looking for candidates in the US & Canada PACIFIC Time Zone. \nAbout You\n\n\nYou’re an experienced technologist. You spent 4 years working on multiple projects in SaaS companies in the world of systems administration, systems engineering or software development with at least 2 years of experience in Site Reliability Engineering or DevOps.\n\n\nYou know the cloud. You’ve participated in the design or maintenance of highly available, cloud-based infrastructure in AWS or another cloud offering. You understand how to leverage infrastructure as code tools and have learned best practices for reliability and observability.  We use tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Redis, GitLab, and Datadog, among others.\n\n\nYou can code. You have experience with languages like Python or Go to create automated tools. You believe in hands-off deployments and infrastructure as code. Well-honed expertise with the fundamentals of software development goes a long way here.\n\n\nYou can solve complex systems challenges. You enjoy complex challenges, understand how to improve performance, and help uncover opportunities for improvement. You’ve worked on problems where “just throw more hardware at it” isn’t enough for the system to scale.\n\n\nYou’re a great communicator. Not only do you know how to share your knowledge with the team and document things well so they can be consumed asynchronously (we do this a lot as a remote company), but you know how to communicate effectively with software and support teams.\n\n\nYou value our values. At Zapier, our values are at the heart of how we collaborate and how we think about our customers. In our remote setting, they help develop trust and ensure we work and collaborate together to democratize automation. You see how these values can empower meaningful work, you thrive in a collaborative setting, you are eager to continue growing and excited to be part of the team.\n\n\n \nThings You’ll Do\nAs part of this team, you’ll work on\n\n\nDesigning and deploying our AWS infrastructure using infrastructure as code (Terraform, Helm, etc) across multiple accounts.\n\n\nContributing to our kubernetes clusters (EKS) and serverless functions (Lambda). Production Engineering provides compute resources as a service, and you’ll help shape what features we offer.\n\n\nEvaluating new tools and recommending technologies to the entire organization. If there’s a tool that will help us serve our customers, we’ll go get it.\n\n\nPartnering with teams to solve novel infrastructure and design problems. Service teams are responsible for keeping services running. It’s your job to help them make decisions that scale.\n\n\nBuilding services to integrate systems, process high-traffic workloads, and perform critical migrations. We don’t believe in drawing a hard line between developers and SREs–if you see a part of the code you can improve, default to action and make the change.\n\n\nUsing site reliability principles, you’ll help fix problems at their root cause rather than just the symptoms. You'll improve application reliability using a software engineering approach to operations. You'll develop internal tools and systems to help engineering teams ship better software, faster. You'll get to impact every engineering team in the organization and use a broad set of technologies. Maintaining excellent relationships and communicating effectively with teams will be crucial to your success.\nBuilding new features and services is a big part of this role. We continually develop and implement new ways to support our teams, understand our customers’ needs, and become experts in site reliability.\nWhen bad things happen, you'll have the support of your team to solve contributing causes, learn from failures, and build robust and resilient systems for our customers. We look for the solution that automates the problem away, not one that requires manual effort.\n \nThings We've Done Recently\n\n\nBuilt dozens of new microservices in Kubernetes across multiple AWS accounts\n\n\nContributed to open-source Kubernetes projects to support autoscaling our stack\n\n\nContinually grown to handle millions of daily requests\n\n\nHandled major migrations between hosting providers, database systems, and stateful technologies\n\n\nCreated rapid deployment pipelines in GitLab and ArgoCD to support continuous delivery\n\n\nBuilt tools to bootstrap new Kubernetes services at the click of a button\n\n\n \nZapier Compensation Guiding Principles\nWe believe all Zapiens should be rewarded competitively and equitably, using practices that are simple and transparent. This philosophy ensures we’re able to find, grow, and retain exceptional people from a broad range of backgrounds. Here’s how we define our compensation principles:\n\n\nCompetitive: Zapier pays well among the technology sector.\n\n\nEquitable: Consistent pay practices; competency-based pay.\n\n\nSimple: Pay is well understood, and pay practices are built for scale.\n\n\nTransparent: Zapiens know how pay works, including how their pay is determined.\n\n\nThe pay ranges for this role are:\nUnited States: 138,300-172,900-207,500 USD\nCanada:           138,300-172,900-207,500 CAD\nA Candidate's compensation package is finalized once the interview process is concluded and accounts for experience, competencies (job knowledge, skills and abilities) and internal equity.\nFor more information on Zapier’s Total Rewards please click here.\n \nHow to Apply\nAt Zapier, we believe that diverse perspectives and experiences make us better, which is why we have a non-standard application process designed to promote inclusion and equity.
