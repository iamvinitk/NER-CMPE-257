Apply here if you are already an exceptional security-focused software engineer.\nMost product engineering teams at Canonical include one or two spaces for dedicated security-oriented software engineers. Their role is to challenge the entire team to think more deeply about security. They contribute to the product as engineers too, but their primary focus is to improve security through state of the art practices - from table-top threat model exercises to architecture reviews, from extended security testing with fuzzers and static analysis tools to external security analyst liaison.\nWe also build a number of products that are entirely motivated by security technology and requirements, such as our AppArmor kernel investments and our hardening, compliance and certification toolkits for Ubuntu.\nAs the publisher of Ubuntu we also handle long-term security response and hardening for the entire operating system and open source universe. Working with tens of thousands of upstreams means that we need to be fluent in every major programming language, and design, build and adopt sophisticated tools that enable us to work at scale and speed with confidence.\nThese roles encompass all aspects of product security, including feature development, vulnerability response, proactive security and open source community participation. All security roles interact closely with many of the other Canonical engineering and development teams, Canonical customers and our partners across the open source community.\nLocation: We have open roles for security specialist software engineers in every timezone.\nWhat you'll do\nSecurity roles might tackle any of the following:\n\nDefine, implement and document new security features \nLead security-oriented thinking in a product engineering team\nAnalyze, fix, and test vulnerabilities in Canonical and open source Software\nContribute to Ubuntu and upstream projects to benefit the community \nAudit and analyze source code for vulnerabilities \nIntegrate new tools in our security infrastructure, pipelines and processes\nAchieve and retain various security certifications \nExtend and enhance Linux cryptographic components - specifically with modules such as OpenSSL/Libgcrypt - with the features and functionality required for country-specific compliance such as FIPS and CC certification \nWork with external partners to develop CIS benchmarks\nDesign and develop hardening automation for Ubuntu \nMonitor the security industry for new developments \nDevelop, test and maintain new software capabilities  \nProvide guidance and support to other engineering teams\n\nWhat we are looking for in you\n\nAn exceptional academic track record from both high school and university\nUndergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path\nDrive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations\nA thorough understanding of the common categories of security vulnerabilities\nModern engineering techniques to find and fix them \nFamiliarity with open source development tools and methodologies \nSkill in one or more of C, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby or PHP\nExperience as a security champion\nExperience driving security within a wider SDLC process \nProfessional written and spoken English \nExperience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) \nExcellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability \nPassion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation \nExcellent communication and presentation skills \nResult-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments \nAbility to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each\n\nOptional skills we also value\n\nClear and effective communication with the team and Ubuntu community members \nExperience working with Linux Kernel \nSecurity Certification experience and knowledge in FIPS and/or CC \nExperience with OVAL (Open Vulnerability Assessment Language) \nKnowledge of and familiarity with low-level Linux cryptography APIs \nDemonstrated high learning ability\nPerformance engineering experience \n\nWhat we offer you\nWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.\n\nDistributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person\nPersonal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year\nAnnual compensation review\nRecognition rewards\nAnnual holiday leave\nMaternity and paternity leave\nEmployee Assistance Programme\nOpportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues\nPriority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events\n\nAbout Canonical\nCanonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do.
