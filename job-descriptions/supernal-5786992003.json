We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the world’s communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving people’s ability to move – whether for work or play.\n \nWhat we do: \nThe Energy Management System Control Engineering team is dedicated to researching and developing control algorithms for power distribution and redundancy management in our HV distribution system and Energy Storage System (ESS). The Sr. Algorithm Engineer is responsible for developing algorithm requirements, conducting research and development, and verifying algorithms after implementation. They work closely with other Hardware, Software, and Cell Engineers in the Battery team, as well as other multi-functional team members, to establish algorithm requirements and ensure traceability. They also support integration testing at the Powertrain, ESS system, or Aircraft level.\nThis position will be required to work on-site 5 days a week.\nWhat you can do:\n\nDevelop Diagnostic Algorithms for detecting and mitigating faults for energy storage and distribution systems with redundancy\nDevelop a strategy to identify faulty systems and select the functioning system from redundant sources\nResearch & develop algorithms for in-range fault detection, operate through failure design considering system reaction times for faulty data and fault detection latencies\nDevelop functionally safe control architectures for safety critical systems to be used in aerospace applications\nSimulation and verification of models and algorithms developed using MIL, SIL, PIL, and HIL techniques at HV battery systems or at the HV power distribution level and support similar activities at the system level (System in the Loop testing)\nOptimization of algorithms and control loops to work within real-time computer resource constraints like CPU cycles, memory, and power consumption\nMay require up to 25% of domestic and international travel\nOther duties as assigned\n\nWhat you can contribute:\n\nBachelor’s degree in Control Systems Electrical Engineering or related field required; Master’s degree preferred\nA minimum of five (5) years of demonstrated diagnostic algorithm development experience in automotive or aerospace industries (an equivalent combination of education and experience may be considered)\nExperience in developing algorithms to detect continuity faults and in-range faults and take action to mitigate the effects of the fault\nAbility to create control algorithms for fault tolerant systems with redundancy management for a product in service\nExperience in developing control algorithms and software for safety-critical applications compliance to DO178C standards; Understanding of DO-178C compliance for SW development is required\nProficiency in using modeling and analysis tools like MATLAB, Simulink, Stateflow, Simscape, or others\nProficiency in programming languages such as C and C++ is vital for developing real-time applications\nExperience in implementing diagnostic algorithms in C and C++ in embedded environments\nHave an understanding of battery cell characteristics, the operational characteristics of electrical components, and the possible failure modes of sensors and actuators\nExcellent skills required in technical communication and reliance on data for issue resolution and decision-making\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills\nProactive delivery of communication and follow up\nExcellent organizational skills and attention to detail\nMust have the ability to independently prioritize and accomplish work within time constraints\nProficiency with Excel VLOOKUP, pivot tables, MS Office Suite\n\nYou may also be able to contribute:\n\nExperience with DFMEA preferred\n\n \nAny offer of employment is conditioned upon the successful completion of a background check.
