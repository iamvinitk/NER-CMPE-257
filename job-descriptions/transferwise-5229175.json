The role is an unique opportunity to join one of the largest fintech companies in the world. You'll be leading and growing our Product team to provide millions of people with frictionless and borderless money management.\nYour Mission\nHolding money with a bank is un-transparent and unfair. It is untransparent because you don’t know what the bank is doing with your money, who they are lending it to and how much they are making from it. It is unfair because they provide you with free services which you don’t know how much they cost to provide and give you almost zero return for holding your money with them. Unfortunately, as interest rates have increased around the world, this problem is getting worse as banks pocket a greater share of this income.\nThe Wise Account is our antidote to holding money in a bank. With our Assets product we enable our customers to invest their money to get a return while continuing to spend and send just like a current account. Customers can choose what it is invested in and what return it makes. We then charge a fair and transparent fee before returning the rest to them. It’s simple; it is our customers' money so they should benefit from the return it generates.\nWe have already launched this disruptive new product in the UK, Europe and Singapore. We need someone to come and help us take this to the next level and provide these services to millions more people around the world. \nCare to help us?\nHere’s how you’ll be contributing to Wise\n\nCreate and launch a new version of the ‘current account’ by enabling customers to get a return on their money while continuing to spend and send without restrictions\nYou’ll be working closely with Designers, Researchers, Developers, Compliance and Analysts to enable the team to make informed decisions and inspire the highest standards of execution\nYou’ll report to the Account product lead, whose role is to help you find your own path to having a massive impact on the Wise mission\n\nThis role will give you the opportunity to\n\nDirectly contribute to our mission to make money without borders the new normal – you will need to figure out and build solutions so that our customers can move money instantly, conveniently, transparently, and – eventually – for free\nBuild world-class products: The role is a unique opportunity to build innovative, state-of-the-art solutions with a global impact\nChoose your path to impact – we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously.
