You keep up with the latest social everything and want to know why it matters. \n You’re a writer and a storyteller – You notice our brand world in ways other don’t and want to write about it in compelling ways that solve problems and spark ideas.  \n You’re not defined by one thing – You may have other interests or specialties and you’re eager to learn new skills and take on new challenges. \n You love this stuff – You feed off the energy and ideas of others, and you’re excited by the prospect of working in an environment that demands creative collaboration. \n\nThe Brooklyn Brothers is always learning, but here are some of the skills we’re looking for:   \n\n Brand Strategy – A track record of using a variety of inputs to develop research-driven strategies and thought-provoking ideas to solve brand problems and compel people to act. \n Brief Writing & Comms Plans – The ability to turn strategy into concise and inspiring creative briefs and effective communications plans. \n Presentation Skills – Experience developing and presenting decks with an informed POV that are thoughtfully-researched, thought-provoking, and concise. \n4. Social-led – Comfortable with social strategies and content, influencer marketing, understanding best practices as well as nascent trends, AI, research and social listening tools, and the ability to put social thinking at the heart of big ideas. \n5. Self-starter – The confidence to own a project from beginning-to-end and act as a trusted client partner and team collaborator. \n6. Kindness & Respect – Because we spend too much time with each other, on screens and in-person, not to be nice. Your ideas are amplified by the opinions of your colleagues and the diverse agency culture you push forward.\n\n \nSalary Range: $55,000-95,000\nThe Brooklyn Brothers has included the base salary or hourly rate for this role.
