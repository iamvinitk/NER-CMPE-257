We deploy, operate, and support our ever growing worldwide and launch pad network of communications antennas, optical tracking systems, and Starlink telemetry, tracking, and control antennas. We perform real-time operations in mission control for Falcon, Dragon, and Starship missions, while also facilitating NASA flight operations interfaces and network integration, as well as mission control video and communications readiness testing. Additionally, as we begin to design and build the Starship based Human Landing System (HLS), this team is responsible for the developing the communications infrastructure that will be used to communicate with our vehicles and humans on and around the moon!As an Automation and Operations Engineer, you will be in mission control for launches and ultimately responsible for the collection of all of the critical telemetry that we need to verify orbital parameters, observe payload deploys, and more. This is an opportunity for impactful problem solving in real time while making data driven decisions that impact the company and launch in profound ways. While not in the control room, you will have the opportunity to build the operational foundation that we require including authoring procedures, writing and testing automation, and doing mission planning for all of the ground communications infrastructure supporting Falcon, Dragon, Starship, and future lunar exploration. You will be in direct control of the ground systems throughout the mission, starting with ground integration through launch and on-orbit operations. You will work with subsystem responsible engineers, software engineers, and electrical design engineers to understand and evaluate how the ground segment assets should be operated and then execute on that vision. Working as a cross disciplinary expert, you will ensure that the software and automation running the full system is safe and reliable. This will require you to make updates to software that not only alerts you to issues but also safely recovers the system autonomously from myriad anomalies, ensuring continued mission success.
