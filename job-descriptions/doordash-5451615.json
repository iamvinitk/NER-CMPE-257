We are building towards personalized consumer journeys, inspiring pages for restaurants and retail categories, intuitive search, and trustworthy reviews to accelerate marketplace growth. \nAbout the Role\nDoorDash is looking for a leader to drive the vision and strategy for delighting consumers during our largest and most impactful occasions of the year - our “tentpole” consumer moments. From the start of Football season to the giftable moments like Valentine’s Day, to our tentpole DoorDash curated moments like Summer of DashPass and Deck the Doorstep – occasions are a critical opportunity to increase consumer & merchant engagement and drive sustainable marketplace growth. We are looking for someone who can build and iterate upon a customer-first strategy for our largest-scale occasions while simultaneously managing and executing the day-to-day actions necessary to achieve our goals.

You feel comfortable structuring goals, outlining the ‘why’ and holding teams accountable to flawless execution.\nYou will report to the Director, User Growth and Consumer Experience in our Consumer Growth Strategy & Operations organization.\nYou’re excited about this opportunity because you will…\n\nBuild & Own – Crafting a framework for approaching these Occasions will not be easy. You must be comfortable with ambiguity & embrace the challenge of having multiple paths forward and many right answers.\nOperate at the Lowest Level of Detail – You will need to bring multi-channel campaigns to life, dive into data, and obsess over user journeys to make sure we create a best in class experience that delights every customer and creates value for every merchant. \nLead & Advocate – This leader will need to bring cross-functional stakeholders along as we build and scale. They must be able to advocate for their business, measure success, ask for help when needed, and lead team members across functions - incl. ads, marketing, product, and analytics - to deliver results. \nBuild & Own – Craft the vision, strategy, and roadmap for DoorDash’s homepage – striking a balance between business goals & customer-first solutions. Manage towards quarterly goals and lead the team to hit objectives.\nInfluence - Influence and motivate people at all levels across a variety of functions internally and externally. You will advocate for the consumer & homepage metrics, align with stakeholders on tradeoffs, and lead team members across product, analytics, & more.\n\nWe’re excited about you because…\n\nYou are entrepreneurial and thrive in fast-paced environments. You have a strong bias for action and want to shape the vision and direction of the company. You don't hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but you're just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team.\nYou're a strong operator and experience leading cross-functional projects. You have a talent for managing complex projects and enjoy implementing processes & building playbooks to increase efficiency. You roll up your sleeves and do whatever it takes to make things successful\nYou like data and summarizing complex problems. You let data win arguments, are comfortable distilling meaningful metrics from large datasets and are excited to use Excel and SQL in your role. \nYou are a humble leader and crave responsibility. You can build a diverse team of strong performers, influencing and motivating people at all levels across a variety of job functions, and helping champion development of DoorDash's future leaders\nYou have 8+ years of experience in product marketing, program management, operations, technology, consulting, strategy, business development, high-growth or early-stage startup or related experience\nBachelor’s Degree required, MBA or Master’s Degree a plus\n\nAbout DoorDash\nAt DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers.
