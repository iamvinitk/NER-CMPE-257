Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nThe Developer Productivity group is responsible for making Stripe’s developers happy and productive. We work on tools, processes, and code refactoring to accelerate Stripe engineering as Stripe scales.\nWe’re looking for people with an interest in building the tools to improve the day to day experience of Engineers in Stripe. The ideal candidate will have a mix of technical expertise in either language processing tools, version control systems, contract testing, build systems, but most importantly a passion for solving developer experience problems, and a pragmatic ability to ship results iteratively. You’ll be working on a mix of fault tolerant distributed systems and also software which runs on individual developer machines.\nWhat you’ll do\nWe have a ton of important work to do, which is why we’re hiring! Our active projects change all the time, but here are a few examples of recent projects so you can get an idea of the types of work we do:\n\nPlan, implement and regularly validate multi-region availability for our CI infrastructure! All of our systems can sustain losing machines, and making our systems even more resistant to failure is a big theme for us. If you like thinking about distributed systems, you might find a good home here!\nDesign and implement industry-leading infrastructure to support contract tests. You’ll help define the features and capabilities of the system, including the generation of synthetic data where appropriate. If you like cross-functional collaboration, and solving real-world problems faced by teams striving to reach five 9s of reliability, this is the area for you!\nIf you love helping developers be more effective at their jobs, we have a ton of interesting projects around improving build reproducibility and performance using Bazel and related tools.\nEnhance the reliability, speed and efficiency of our largest builds. One of the key ways to execute builds efficiently is to bake incrementality into every aspect of the build process. We have accomplished a significant amount in this area, but have a long way to go! Additionally, when an incremental test run consists of a few hundred thousand tests, a handful of bad tests which randomly fail can cause a cascade of build failures. Building and enhancing the system responsible for detecting these will be critical to keep Stripe scaling!\nEnhance the ability for Engineers to test new workflows on their local machines, and in CI.\n\nResponsibilities\nBuild large scale distributed systems, tools and libraries that serve as the interface to data infrastructure for all of Stripe’s engineering teams\n\nMaintaining and evolving existing distributed, and local, services.\nCollaborating with engineers on the team, as well as cross-functional stakeholders, to develop prototype solutions for domains which are underserved by existing tooling.\nDesign, build, and maintain distributed cloud infrastructure services\nParticipate in roadmap planning and prioritization\n\nWho you are\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to beconsidered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you areencouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not arequirement.\nMinimum requirements\n\n4+ years of professional, full-time software development experience\nExperience designing, developing, maintaining and debugging distributed systems built with open source tools\nExperience building tools to improve developer productivity, and empathy for the end users\nExperience writing high quality code in a major programming language, preferably Ruby, Java, or gocode.\nA background supporting engineer focused tools.\n\nPreferred qualifications\n\nExperience optimizing the end to end performance and reliability of distributed Systems\nProficiency in either Java or Ruby.\nFamiliarity with data privacy best practices\nExcellent communication skills and the ability to work well in a collaborative environment\nExperience mentoring and leading other engineers is a plus\n\n \n ","departments":[{"id":61590,"name":"8110
