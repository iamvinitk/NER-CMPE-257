This means that candidates for the Sales Engineer role cannot negotiate Quorum’s base salary offer.\nHere’s our promise to you:\n\nWe will not ask you what you are currently earning.\nWe will consider years of relevant experience, relevant professional certifications/education, and performance expectations in setting what we believe is a competitive, fair base salary offer.\nWe will be transparent about our compensation structure (see above) so that all candidates have equal access to compensation information and can make an informed decision about whether or not Quorum is the right workplace for them.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about how negotiation impacts pay equity and/or why other start-ups have decided to implement a “No Negotiation” policy of some type, here are a few resources: Project Include, AAUW, Ministry for Women, Magoosh.\nNote: Quorum does not endorse or verify any of the information provided in the resources on the impact of negotiation on pay equity. We provide these resources simply to increase awareness of a topic we believe is important for both employers and candidates to consider.  \nWe comply with all requirements for US government federal contractors issued by the OFCCP, IFR, and the terms of our government contracts.","departments":[{"id":31526,"name":"Business Development","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":21417,"name":"Washington D.C.
