Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches worldwide.\nAbout The Role:\nAs our customers expand their usage to hundreds of users and documents, and as we provide them with more and more functionality, we will need to evolve our architecture to meet the needs and empower our teams to deliver value to our customers. You'll lead a team of engineers and managers responsible for evolving the core parts of Notion’s architecture to enable our vision for years to come. Your team is responsible for building data and UI abstractions for core Notion features to enable our growing scale and complexity.\nEngineering managers at Notion are responsible for creating and fostering user-focused, collaborative, and high-performing teams that build products to empower everyone as a toolmaker. In this specific role, you will work with customer teams and leadership to understand our strategy and set your team's strategy accordingly. You will drive execution in your team to deliver impact. Additionally, as an engineering leader at Notion, you will contribute to up-leveling Notion's entire engineering organization.\nWhat You'll Do:\n\nYou'll build and manage a diverse and inclusive team of engineers and managers working on core parts of Notion's architecture. You'll create a healthy environment in your team that embodies Notion's values.\nYou'll recruit, coach, and develop engineers. You'll ensure engineers are regularly receiving feedback and making progress on personal and professional goals.\nYou'll facilitate planning—the prioritization, sequencing, and staffing of work—for your team.\nYou'll be responsible for maintaining a high-quality bar for everything your team ships.\nYou'll own execution in your team to develop a steady cadence of delivering value to your users.\nYou'll work with others to shape how Notion's engineering organization works. You'll help develop our technical practices, recruiting and onboarding strategy, planning and prioritization process, and more.\n\nWhat We're Looking For:\n\nYou have managed senior engineering teams and managers, and have experience in scaling teams.\nYou have built, or are committed to building, diverse and inclusive teams.\nYou create team environments that are at once collaborative, empowering, supportive, and challenging—ones where engineers do their best work.\nYou have a sufficiently deep background in product and technology that you can ask the right questions of your team, balance product, tech, and people concerns, and make hard tradeoffs.\nYou think rigorously. You're prepared to tackle the toughest technical problems, understand trade-offs, and enable teams to make decisions and progress.\nYou have a high tolerance for ambiguity and change, especially around organizational structure and the boundaries of your role. You enjoy jumping into whatever areas need attention and learning as-you-go.\nYou value empathetic and direct communication, particularly when giving and receiving feedback.\n\n\nBonus Points:\n\nYou have managed engineering teams at startups before, particularly during periods of rapid growth and organizational change.\nYou have experience rolling out engineering and management practices and processes—e.g., code review, performance reviews, and levels and ladders—where they didn't exist before.\nYou've managed teams that are across multiple offices.\nYou've heard of computing pioneers like Ada Lovelace, Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, and others—and understand why we're big fans of their work.\n\nOur customers come from all walks of life and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds, not just because it's the right thing to do, but because it makes our company stronger. If you share our values and our enthusiasm for small businesses, you will find a home at Notion.\nNotion is proud to be an equal opportunity employer.
