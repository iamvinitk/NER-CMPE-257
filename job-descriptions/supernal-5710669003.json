We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the world’s communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving people’s ability to move – whether for work or play.\nWhat we do: \nThe Senior CLAW Engineer will be a member of the Flight Controls team who will actively participate in designing and implementing the algorithms for the aircraft. This role will be heavily involved in the analysis of aircraft stability, defining the control architecture, testing control law implementation and dynamics. The Sr. Engineer will conduct testing both on a desktop simulation as well as in the systems integration lab and will be involved in certification aspects of applying ARP 4754A and DO-178C rules to their control law design. The role will collaborate with engineering teams throughout the business in the design and testing of the control laws.\nThis position will be required to work on-site 5 days a week.\nWhat you can do:\n\nDesign and implement flight control algorithms for a VTOL aircraft with a novel configuration\nProficiency in implementing classical and modern control law\nConduct trade studies between different design considerations and control schemes.\nDefine control system architecture, response types, etc. for an aircraft that might change configuration between flight regimes.\nConduct stability and control related analyses in time and frequency domain.\nCollaborate with the Systems engineering team to define requirements related to the flight control system and system safety\nMay require up to 10% of domestic and international travel\n\nWhat you can contribute:\n\nB.S. in aerospace or relevant engineering field required\nA minimum of 5-8 years of experience in flight control algorithm design for rotary-wing and/or fixed-wing Fly-By-Wire aircraft systems (an equivalent combination of education and experience may be considered)\nProven experienced in analyzing flight dynamic modes for stability and control\nExperience with actuator and motor control loops\nExperience with mixing and blending of control surface commands\nExperience with flight testing\nExperience with sensor processing and Kalman filter design\nExperience with requirement definition\nExperience on aircraft with multiple different modes of flight, including vertical lift\nExperience building control laws for unmanned aircraft could be beneficial\nExperience with system identification and optimization tools (CIFER, CONDUIT)\nExperience in math model development of a physical system\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills\nProactive delivery of communication and follow up\nExcellent organizational skills and attention to detail\nMust have the ability to independently prioritize and accomplish work within time constraints\nSelf-motivated and forward-thinking personality\nFamiliarity with DO-178B/C, DO-160, DO-254, ARP 4754A, ARP 4761\nExpertise in MathWorks® tools for control algorithm development\nFamiliarity with FAA part 23/25/27/29 or other certification experience\nFamiliarity with aircraft handling quality requirements\nFamiliarity with DO-331\n\nYou may also be able to contribute:\n\nM.S. or PhD preferred\nSome experience in C++ is beneficial\n\nAny offer of employment is conditioned upon the successful completion of a background check.
