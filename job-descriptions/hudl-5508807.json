We hire the best of the best to ensure you’re working with people you can constantly learn from. You’re trusted to get your work done your way while testing the limits of what’s possible and what’s next. We work hard to provide a culture where everyone feels supported, and our employees feel it—their votes helped us become one of Newsweek's Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces in 2023.\nWe also value sports. Not just because of the big wins and highlight-worthy plays, but because of the lasting impact sports can have: the lifelong lessons in teamwork and dedication; the influence of inspiring mentors; the priceless opportunities to play at the next level. Sports can change lives—that’s what we value.\nOur team helps the world see sports differently through products that make it easier to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and do a lot more.  \nReady to join us?\nYour Role\nWe’re looking for someone to lead our team of Solutions Consultants, focusing on pre-sales efforts in Northern Europe for our customers across governing bodies, leagues, clubs and agencies. You’ll be structuring pre-sales methodologies, tracking the efficiency and impact of our Customer Solutions team in the global Elite sales cycle. You’ll also leverage your knowledge of high performance workflows using our Pro Suite to drive education, pipeline creation, support qualification and conversion rates, as well as product innovation efforts within the company. \nFor this role, we're currently considering candidates who live within commuting distance of our offices in Leeds, London, Barcelona, Milan or Chiavari. But with our flexible work policy, there aren't any current requirements for the number of days you come to the office.\nMust-Haves\n\nExperience. You have extensive familiarity with high performance sports environments, and have hands-on knowledge of Hudl products and others in the market. You also have a strong network of industry connections, ideally in the global football and/or rugby worlds.\nA people leader. You’ve formally led other direct reports (e.g., hiring, onboarding, performance management, development, etc.) and are able to coach your team members effectively.\nExcellent communication. You’re able to effectively qualify sales opportunities, and convey ideas and solutions to customers and internal stakeholders. You thrive in quantifying value and giving proposals, product demonstrations, presentations, and other customer communications.\nGoal-oriented. You’re motivated by improving the customer experience and hitting revenue goals within your team and region.\n\nNice-to-Haves\n\nCustomer-facing experience. You understand SaaS sales methodologies and consulting methodologies, know why we always put the customer first, and strive to generate revenue by excelling at technical pre-sales and solution consulting.\nPre-Sales Consulting leadership. You have experience leading pre-sales consulting teams, ideally within a SaaS business.\nProduct development. You’ve influenced or supported product development in SaaS for sports before.\nMultilingual. Fluent English is a must, any other languages are a plus.\n\nOur Role \n\nChampion work-life harmony. We’ll give you the flexibility you need in your work life (e.g., flexible vacation time above any required statutory leave, company-wide holidays and timeout (meeting-free) days, remote work options and more) so you can enjoy your personal life too.\nGuarantee autonomy. We have an open, honest culture and we trust our people from day one. Your team will support you, but you’ll own your work and have the agency to try new ideas.\nEncourage career growth. We’re lifelong learners who encourage professional development. We’ll give you tons of resources and opportunities to keep growing.\nProvide an environment to help you succeed. We've invested in our offices, designing incredible spaces with our employees in mind. But whether you’re at the office or working remotely, we’ll provide you the tech you need to do your best work.\nSupport your wellbeing. Depending on location, we offer medical and retirement benefits for employees—but no matter where you’re located, we have resources like our Employee Assistance Program and employee resource groups to support your mental health.\nInclusion at Hudl\nHudl is an equal opportunity employer. Through our actions, behaviors and attitude, we’ll create an environment where everyone, no matter their differences, feels like they belong. We offer resources to ensure our employees feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work, including employee resource groups and communities. But we recognize there’s ongoing work to be done, which is why we track our efforts and commitments in annual inclusion reports. We also know imposter syndrome is real and the confidence gap can get in the way of meeting spectacular candidates.
