New Verticals include the DashMart, Convenience, Alcohol, Grocery, and Retail businesses. These categories bring about new challenges and opportunities to build something at DoorDash from the ground up. You will sit on our non-technical Strategy & Operations team, reporting into a Manager on the team.\nAbout the Role\nYou will help shape DoorDash's future catalog strategy and advertising experience in convenience, grocery, alcohol, and retail. You will tackle and own some of the most novel problems, specifically building out the advertiser onboarding journey in orchestration with end-to-end catalog platform experience. Your work will be highly visible and impactful - with the entire DoorDash New Verticals catalog and merchants in scope, you will impact customers and advertisers in partnership with Machine Learning, Engineering, Product, Data Science, and Sales teams. You will partner with teams across DoorDash and beyond to build a world-class experience that works for all 3 sides of the marketplace (Merchants, Dashers and Customers) and our emerging 4th side (Advertisers). Your work will enable advertisers to onboard quickly and merchandise effectively, customers to make informed buying decisions with rich attributes, and Dashers to know exactly what to shop, and where. You will report to a Manager on the New Verticals Catalog, Fulfillment and Logistics team. We operate in a hybrid model; all of our offices are open and we get together in person for offsites once or twice a quarter!\nYou’re excited about this opportunity because you will…\n\nLead. You will lead, collaborate and influence cross-functional teams to build and scale DoorDash’s catalog and advertiser platform.\nStrategize. You will help shape the future of our advertiser experience. You will create quarterly and annual plans that push our business forward and are aligned with our product capabilities. You will help these teams identify opportunities for enhancing our existing product offering and build new processes. \nAnalyze. You love working with data and using data to drive business decision-making. \nBuild. You will build a massive high-quality advertiser catalog with perfect information (e.g. - product photography, item descriptions, and other rich metadata), high quality scores and operational checks and controls. This means everything from high-level strategy to operational details.\nCollaborate. You will advocate internally for solutions to enhance the user experience. Where a product or operations solution is needed to unlock growth and reduce cost, you will advocate for those resources with your partners.\nLearn. You will be immersed in our US and International grocery and retail operations. You will learn about our product and in-store operations, product roadmaps, and our current and future capabilities.\n\nWe’re excited about you because…\n\nYou solve problems from first principles. You’re excited to think innovatively, and you resist “this is how it’s always been done” thinking.\nYou’re comfortable with ambiguity. You thrive in new spaces and are excited by the possibility of discovering and solving novel problems\nYou’re equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You don’t hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but you’re just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team.\nYou’re analytical. You’re comfortable building complex SQL queries across multiple data sources and have experience with data visualization and dashboarding tools.\nYou have 4-6+ years of experience. You’ve succeeded in high-performing cultures (tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, or a related experience), and you’ve led teams to achieve audacious goals.\n\nAbout DoorDash\nAt DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods. DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nWe’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities.
