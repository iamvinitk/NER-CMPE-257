And the most advanced companies are realizing the full data advantage by partnering with Pure Storage. Pure’s vision is to redefine the storage experience and empower innovators by simplifying how people consume and interact with data.

Our Engineers are solving complex engineering problems (from low-level system software to cloud computing) that help us innovate our cutting-edge products. Besides our world-class Software Engineering teams, we have many other talented colleagues working in Product Management, Sales, Finance, and HR to name a few. What’s more, we’ve developed these teams from talent across the globe.\nFLASHARRAY\nOur customers love our flagship product FlashArray, for its simplicity of management, a constant flow of new and exciting innovation and its ability to expand on cutting-edge technology with no downtime, ever. Most recently, we extended the value of our FlashArray capabilities into the cloud with CloudSnap and Cloud Block Store for AWS. These new innovations enable our customers to leverage the agility of the public cloud for both traditional IT and cloud-native applications. \nTo help FlashArray remain an industry-leading product, our team in Prague is developing core and groundbreaking features for our customers across the globe. Data has no boundaries and with it, our engineering reach to tackle problems in the Data domain being in the cloud, private data centers, or the hybrid cloud. We are seeking engineers to solve tough problems and leapfrog us in the as-a-service model. Be part of the change, don't wait for one!\nENGINEERING PRODUCTIVITY\nThe Platform Automation Engineering team is a team consisting of C++/Python engineers with the focus to build platform solutions to enable engineering feature development. The engineers who join this team will have the opportunity to work on our core software - Purity by developing/enhancing feature sets that will allow us to build platform solutions. One such example is the Post Test Analysis (PTA) which is an extensible platform that automatically process, evaluates, and analyses automated test failures, and notifies and reconfigures other part of engineering productivity infrastructure. Why is this important? We are a customer focus company and customer experience is the key measure of success. To achieve this, every piece of code we deliver to our customers must be of the highest quality possible, and to that, we must test every piece of code in as many dimensions as possible. Working with such a large scale of (often low-level) automated tests would consume many hours of our engineers, thus PTA makes most of hard work for them.\nIN THIS ROLE YOU WILL BE...\n\nDevelop and extend our post test analysis platform.\nDevelop automated test framework and infrastructure for all-flash storage arrays.\nImprove product quality and reliability of automated testing infrastructure.\nCollaborate with world-class storage engineers to define test automation requirements by participating in product design reviews.\nFind new ways to develop more efficient product leveraging open-source technologies\nCollaborate with support, release, engineering and management teams to improve product quality by increasing automated test coverage.\n\nWHAT YOU’LL NEED TO BRING TO THIS ROLE...\n\nYou enjoy software test automation and build test platforms to improve the quality of code delivery.\nSoftware development experience, preferably in or have interest in Python.\nExperience with working or interacting with Unix/Linux systems.\nExperience with Test-Driven Development, and Continuous Integration.\nExperience with networking and storage protocols and management a plus.\nExperience in development and testing of RESTful web services and backend APIs a plus.\nTech Stack: Python, C/C++, Linux, container technologies, and more.\nYou are comfortable with a collaborative, transparent and agile environment.\n\nYou will be based in Prague, Czech Republic.
