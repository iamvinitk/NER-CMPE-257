Apply here if you are an exceptional Go, Rust, or C/C++ software engineer and want to work on next-generation open source VMM or container technology, or related open source networking and storage.\nContainer, virtualisation and cloud infrastructure have become essentials of modern software deployments. We invest in open source related to application isolation, workload orchestration, system or OCI containers, micro service architecture or cloud infrastructure.\nHere are some examples of projects under way at Canonical.\nRustVMM has great potential as a new hypervisor for Linux. We are building a team to work on this, with an emphasis on performance, security and operability. Work in Rust and bring your expert knowledge of VMM and related kernel networking and storage capabilities.\nDocker images are easy to make and publish on Docker Hub and other registries, but the quality, consistency and security maintenance of those images is broadly very poor. Canonical is in a good position to publish a portfolio of outstanding Docker images. Our Rockcraft team is designing and implementing an elevated Docker image experience for the open source community.\nLXD is a modern system container and virtual machine manager that is widely used on Ubuntu, ChromeOS and other Linux platforms. LXD engineering spans the entire software stack from low-level kernel work on namespaces, confinement, security, filesystems, VMMs and networking, to the high level management REST API and CLI.\nMembers of the Kubernetes product team build MicroK8s for on-rails K8s, and Charmed Kubernetes for more sophisticated integration. We work on K8s itself and on the operations tooling around it.\nThe OpenStack team deliver Charmed OpenStack, OVN / OVS and Ceph. This work brings cloud platform technologies to large-scale computing environments.\nThese teams hire system level C/C++, Golang, Rust and Python developers to work on security-critical, performance-critical and mission-critical code, focused on software delivery, containers, security, sandboxing, application orchestration and management. Our teams are motivated to have a meaningful impact on modern cloud computing technologies.\nLocation: we have remote container and virt engineering roles in every time zone.\nWhat you will focus on\n\nDesign and specify new features, building consensus on approach\nEngage with upstream communities in your area of expertise\nConduct security analysis and reviews to ensure defence in depth\nCreate and monitor performance benchmarks to optimise your product\nCollaborate proactively with a distributed team\nWrite high quality code to create new features\nDebug issues and produce high quality code to fix them\nReview code produced by other engineers\nDiscuss ideas and collaborate on finding good solutions\n\nWhat we are looking for in you\n\nAn exceptional academic track record from both high school and university\nUndergraduate degree in Computer Science or STEM, or a compelling narrative about your alternative path\nDrive and a track record of going above-and-beyond expectations\nYou have worked on open source virt or container tech\nYou have experience working in the kernel or very low level system\nProfessional written and spoken English \nExperience with Linux (Debian or Ubuntu preferred) \nExcellent interpersonal skills, curiosity, flexibility, and accountability \nPassion, thoughtfulness, and self-motivation \nExcellent communication and presentation skills \nResult-oriented, with a personal drive to meet commitments \nAbility to travel twice a year, for company events up to two weeks each\n\nAdditional skills we value\n\nPerformance engineering and security experience\n\nWhat we offer you\nWe consider geographical location, experience, and performance in shaping compensation worldwide. We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.\n\nDistributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person\nPersonal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year\nAnnual compensation review\nRecognition rewards\nAnnual holiday leave\nMaternity and paternity leave\nEmployee Assistance Programme\nOpportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues\nPriority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events\n\nAbout Canonical\nCanonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to open source. As the company that publishes Ubuntu, one of the most important open source projects and the platform for AI, IoT and the cloud, we are changing the world on a daily basis. We recruit on a global basis and set a very high standard for people joining the company. We expect excellence - in order to succeed, we need to be the best at what we do. Canonical has been a remote-first company since its inception in 2004.​ Working here is a step into the future, and will challenge you to think differently, work smarter, learn new skills, and raise your game.\nCanonical is an equal opportunity employer\nWe are proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background create a better work environment and better products. Whatever your identity, we will give your application fair consideration.\n#LI-remote\n","departments":[{"id":85345,"name":"Engineering","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":44282,"name":"Home Based - Worldwide","location":null,"child_ids":[],"parent_id":73277}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
