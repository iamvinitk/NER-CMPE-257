We believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success and appreciate the experiences each person brings beyond the traditional job requirements. If you’re a close but not exact match with the description, we hope you’ll still consider applying. Want to learn more about life at Klaviyo? Visit careers.klaviyo.com to see how we empower creators to own their own destiny.Klaviyo has an exciting new opportunity in our New Products org responsible for identifying new, unique challenges to solve for our customers. The New Products org launched Reviews in Q2 2023 (see keynote from our CEO announcing the product here and product page here) and is a critical part of Klaviyo’s future expansion into new markets.\nProduct Owners on the New Products team are fast-moving leaders who own the delivery of product roadmaps which help drive significant business outcomes. Compared to Product Managers, Product Owners are more entrepreneurial and flexible in their approach, focusing on the success and growth of the new product area they’re responsible for. They pair closely with leaders of each new product to drive visible business outcomes in scrappy ways. At Klaviyo, you’ll work in the kind of high-growth environment that offers big potential, and Klaviyo’s fast growth will ensure that opportunities abound. \nAs a Product Owner for a new product offering (code named Atlas), you will join a unique, entrepreneurial team building a startup within Klaviyo! At this point in time, the existing Atlas team has been working on product ideas and MVPs around this new product area for ~2 months. You will have significant opportunities to influence and lead decisions around Klaviyo’s entry into this new product area, as well as how products in this area relate back to the core Klaviyo product.\nIn the future, you will lead the charge in growing a new product at Klaviyo scale by leading a team of designers and engineers to execute the features and improvements. You will report to the Head of Atlas, sharing your learnings and influencing the strategy and plans for the product. This is a highly visible project where your work has a clear and direct impact on business metrics, and you’re given a high degree of autonomy to make things happen. \nHow You’ll Make a Difference:\n\nThe ultimate measure of success for Product Owners at Klaviyo is driving business outcomes. That’s why we focus on tracking, analyzing, and improving metrics for each area of our product, with a particular focus on driving the results we target. \nYou will work alongside the Head of Atlas to understand and collaborate on the vision and strategy of the product and the business unit. You will own the execution of that vision and strategy by driving product development and roadmap delivery. \nWe cannot build products that exceed our customers’ expectations without truly understanding those customers. That’s why Product Owners at Klaviyo spend a significant amount of time interacting with customers, from helping with sales to support. At Klaviyo, knowledge about our customers is power.\nProduct Owners at Klaviyo think deeply, quickly, and analytically. You should love to tease out problems, break them down to small, digestible pieces, and put them back together elegantly.\nSomeone who joins Klaviyo must be exceptional at articulating their thinking through presentations and the written word. As a company, our success is gated on collectively being great and prolific communicators.\nYou will scope out the end-to-end experience for our users and identify the right partners to deliver on an exceptional customer experience. Your influence will span across many teams, from Engineering and Design to Marketing and Customer Success. You are ultimately responsible for on-time and high-quality delivery of customer experiences. \n\nWhat You’ll Do:\n\nCollaborate and communicate - you will collaborate with cross-functional teams within the company and all parties outside of the company to be most effective in your role.\nCreate and execute on a roadmap - you will work with the Atlas team to build a roadmap that delivers high value to customers.

You are the go-to person for plans and timelines for everyone else in the org. \nShip features - You will get value into customer hands. For all of the work that goes into planning and coordination, we stay focused on delivering improved solutions and experiences every day. \nSolve customer issues - When customers run into challenges that others can’t solve, you will lead the team in triaging, identifying potential solutions, and deciding on the best path forward. \nLearn - you will be a voracious learner.  A lack of experience/knowledge around a challenge is an invitation to dive deep and become an expert in that area. You should love learning and tackling new challenges.\n\nYour First 90 Days\nIn your first 30 days, you will get acclimated to Klaviyo and begin to work on the future of the Atlas product:\n\nDuring the first two weeks, you will be immersed in an onboarding program that introduces you to the company and the product.\nExtensively familiarize yourself with Klaviyo’s platform and the existing thesis and ideation around Atlas\nSpend time listening to and shadowing customer calls\nFamiliarize yourself with the product vision, roadmap and strategy behind Atlas.

It is your job to reduce ambiguity, ensure visibility and alignment of your projects\nOrganized and have a strong attention to detail that helps guide you in making decisions and delivering high quality products\nEntrepreneurial spirit matters more than years of experience and seniority.  \nThe pay range for this role is listed below.
