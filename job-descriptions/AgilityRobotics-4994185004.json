Our robot, Digit, is the first to be sold into workplaces across the globe. Our team is differentiated by its expertise in imagining, engineering, and delivering robots with advanced mobility, dexterity, intelligence, and efficiency -- robots specifically designed to work alongside people, in spaces built for people. Every day, we break through engineering challenges and invent new solutions and capabilities that will one day make robots commonplace and approachable. This work is our passion and our responsibility: our mission is to make businesses more productive and people’s lives more fulfilling.About The Role\nOur software team is growing rapidly and we are looking for talented engineers to join our small, agile, world-class team. In this role you will work within the Perception Sensors team to drive efforts to develop and maintain an efficient and reliable onboard sensors system for our current and next generation robots. The team is responsible for ensuring that sensors “just work” for the rest of the software stack. The team makes sure the robot is designed with the right sensors for the job, that these sensors are properly calibrated, and that the pipeline that streams sensor data into other modules of our onboard system is optimized for performance and usability. As such the team has a diverse set of tasks, from interfacing with hardware design, to sensor selection and validation, to designing and building sensor calibration systems, and software framework and pipeline design for performant operation. You will contribute to one or more of these tasks.\nAbout The Work (you will contribute to one or more of these)\n\nDrive efforts to develop and maintain an efficient and reliable onboard sensing system for our current and next generation products, going from raw data generated by a variety of sensor modalities to consumable data for perception algorithms.\nWrite performant, well-tested, maintainable, and well documented C++ software.\nImplement automated testing to ensure the robustness of both the sensor hardware and software, ensuring that sensors work and handle errors gracefully no matter what environment the robot encounters.\nWrite tools to analyze and visualize sensor performance and calibration accuracy and precision.\nEvaluate a variety of cutting-edge sensors to determine the optimal sensing system for our next-generation robots.\nWork with cross-functional teams to communicate perception system requirements, evaluate trade-offs in sensing technologies, and optimize the sensing system architecture to meet those requirements.\nDevelop algorithms for onboard sensor fault and anomaly detection.\nDevelop accurate, repeatable and production ready sensor calibration systems.\nTest and deploy code on a state-of-the-art humanoid robot.\n\nAbout You\n\nFluent in C++ (c++17 and up preferred). Extensive experience with statically typed languages and memory management also considered.\nExpert in system design, data structures, multi-threading, memory management, data structures, object-oriented programming, and common design patterns.\nAbility to introspect, analyze, and debug large, complicated software systems.\nStrong system design skills and experience for hardware adjacent software.\nAbility to communicate and document designs and projects.\nWork with and mentor junior engineers.\nWorked on real-time projects that process lots of data with low latency.\nLove working on software that interacts with real world devices.\n\n \nBonus Points\n\nPreferably worked at a robotics company, but any hardware company with lots of sensors is good (AR/VR, drones, cars, etc).\nExperience working with a variety of sensors (monocular cameras, stereo cameras, lidar, ect).\nVision sensor calibration experience.\nDeveloped on constrained embedded systems.\nCan tinker with low level hardware (microcontrollers, signal generation, etc).\nHave written Linux drivers or at least built Linux OS from scratch.\nFamiliar with networking protocols, display drivers, rendering. \nExperience with high-speed data protocols\nExperience with GPU architectures and CUDA programing.\n\nBenefits \n\nCompetitive Compensation Package\n100% Company Paid Disability, Life, Health, Dental & Vision Insurance (for AR employees)\nEmployer Matched Retirement Plan\nFive Weeks of Paid Time Off Annually\nPaid Parental Leave\nTuition Reimbursement\nEmployee Referral Bonus Program\nRelocation Assistance (for certain roles)\nStock Options (for certain roles)\nA culture that encourages flexible work schedules\nA culture that embraces individuality and authenticity\n\nAgility Robotics is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. Each individual has the right to work in a professional atmosphere that promotes equal employment opportunities and prohibits unlawful discriminatory practices, including harassment. Therefore, it is the policy of Agility Robotics to ensure equal employment opportunity without discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, marital status, citizenship, national origin, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.
