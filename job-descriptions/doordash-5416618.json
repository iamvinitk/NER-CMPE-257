New Verticals include the DashMart, Convenience, Alcohol, Grocery, and Retail businesses. These categories bring about new challenges and opportunities to build something at DoorDash from the ground up. \nAbout the Role\nYou will sit in the Fulfillment, Logistics & Catalog group within our New Verticals Strategy & Operations organization. We are hiring two positions on this team, so you’ll have the opportunity to be considered for both roles at once!  \nYou will help shape DoorDash's future inventory and selection strategy across our convenience, grocery, alcohol, and retail businesses as we transition the team to become a Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence-first platform. Your work will impact how merchants think about integrating their inventory to our platform and how consumers explore our inventory selection. You will partner with teams across DoorDash and beyond to build a world-class inventory system that works for all 3 sides of the marketplace (Merchants, Dashers and Customers) and our emerging 4th side (Advertisers). Your work will enable merchants and advertisers to onboard quickly and merchandise effectively, customers to make informed buying decisions with rich merchandising, and Dashers to know exactly what to shop, and where.\nYou’re excited about this opportunity because you will…\n\nBuild the Future: You will help develop the strategy for groceries/perishables and general retail operations. You will create quarterly and annual plans that push our business forward and are aligned with our product capabilities. You will help these teams identify opportunities for enhancing our existing product offering and methods to improve delivery quality.\nCollaborate & Influence: Become the voice of innovation! Champion solutions to enhance the user experience. Where a product or operations solution is needed to unlock growth and reduce cost, you will advocate for those resources with your central partners.\nAnalyze: You love working with data and using data to drive business decision-making\nLearn: You will be deeply Immersed in our US and International grocery and retail operations, forming a POV on the best path forward on in-store operations and product roadmaps alongside a dynamic high performing team. \n\nWe’re excited about you because…\n\nYou solve problems from first principles. You’re excited to think innovatively, and you resist “this is how it’s always been done” thinking.\nYou’re equally comfortable operating at 10,000 feet and 1 foot. You don’t hesitate to get in the weeds and operate at the lowest level of detail, but you’re just as comfortable thinking long-term and inspiring a team.\nYou’re analytical. You’re comfortable building complex SQL queries across multiple data sources and have experience with data visualization and dashboarding tools.\nYou have 4-6+ years of experience. You’ve succeeded in fast-paced cultures (tech, operations, strategy, consulting, banking, or a related experience), and you’ve led teams to achieve audacious goals.\n\nAbout DoorDash\nAt DoorDash, our mission to empower local economies shapes how our team members move quickly, learn, and reiterate in order to make impactful decisions that display empathy for our range of users—from Dashers to merchant partners to consumers. We are a technology and logistics company that started with door-to-door delivery, and we are looking for team members who can help us go from a company that is known for delivering food to a company that people turn to for any and all goods. DoorDash is growing rapidly and changing constantly, which gives our team members the opportunity to share their unique perspectives, solve new challenges, and own their careers. We're committed to supporting employees’ happiness, healthiness, and overall well-being by providing comprehensive benefits and perks including premium healthcare, wellness expense reimbursement, paid parental leave and more.\nOur Commitment to Diversity and Inclusion\nWe’re committed to growing and empowering a more inclusive community within our company, industry, and cities.
