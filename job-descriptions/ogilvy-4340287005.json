You need to be able to shrink lots of data into just the right bits that help bring people up to speed quickly; saving them time and increasing their knowledge base.  People look to you for knowledge - you have an eye for the zeitgeist and bring forward topical ideas proactively. You are curious about people and what makes them tick. And you help apply this knowledge to unlock ways of creatively growing your clients’ businesses and brands.\nWhat You’ll Do \n\nDeveloping campaign and communications strategies based on business / brand goals\nRepresenting the agency’s strategic viewpoint in front of clients\nLeading creative briefings with agency teams\nResponding to and helping to improve creative work\nCreating positioning territories and Big IdeaL statements\nDeveloping strategic communications platform ideas\nDeveloping / Supporting the development of creative channel strategies\n\nThe Skills You Learn and Apply\n\nWriting presentations that establish a clear and persuasive POV\nCreating action plans for research: analysing tracking studies and setting up / conducting qualitative research. You provide guidance on what techniques to use and when.\nCollaborating and knowing how to “work the building” – borrowing skills from others to solve your thornier challenges\nYou understand how brands are constructed and how that informs more than just advertising\nYou’re comfortable with different branding techniques, e.g. purpose building to archetypes.\nHow to establish your presence and authority in front of clients and colleagues\nRunning client workshops in partnership with colleagues to create collaborative solutions\nWriting case studies and awards entries\n\nThe qualities that will make you successful\n\nConstruction of compelling narratives\nConfidence to work independently\nAble to influence others & build client relationships\nManage 2-3 projects simultaneously\nCan lead small pitches alone\nc. 4-8 years’ experience\n\nYou’re ready to move up when you’re leading the strategy on a brand / brands. You can develop action plans and lead large projects, pitches or small accounts. You have the ability and maturity to take on an “apprentice.” You understand different ways communications work and can tailor solutions to different problems. You are a creative problem solver who cracks the nut.\nHow We’ll Support You \nOgilvy celebrates its people. Fully. Enthusiastically. Unhesitatingly. We’ll empower you with the tools you’ll need to succeed. We’ll give you the autonomy to seek out new paths and better ways of doing things.
