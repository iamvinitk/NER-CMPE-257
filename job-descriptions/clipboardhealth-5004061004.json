We dramatically improve lives, by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want, and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.\nAbout Clipboard Health:\nClipboard Health is a post-Series C, extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects, revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote team. We have been named one of YC’s Top Companies for two years running, and have grown 25x across all key metrics in the last 18 months. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities, who can then better serve patients. To learn more about the culture at Clipboard Health, take a look at our culture hub here.About the Role:\nWe think we can build many, many more labor marketplaces than “just” our current Long Term Care business. In fact, we’ve already proven that we can run multiple verticals on the same infrastructure. We brought our Dental and Pharmacy verticals to over $1M annualized GMV each without building a single additional feature to support them. \nWe’ve never had more conviction that the list of attractive opportunities in front of us is as long as we’d hoped, and we have already learned a lot about how to launch and scale verticals. We install what are effectively vertical-level CEOs (“vertical owners,” in our lingo) that push through ambiguity within the following framework:\n\nDiscovery: A ~2-week motion where you exclusively speak to operators and professionals in potential next verticals to get signal on the size and quality of the next opportunity.\n0→1: Pushing ruthlessly towards a first transaction with the goal of getting a read on (a) pull from the market (how bad does their problem burn?) and (b) “smoothness” (how quickly do we think we could scale the business with our current infrastructure?).\n1→10: Scaling aggressively to hundreds of transactions per month while building conviction that the end state of the business is financially lucrative (even if the path to get there is costly).\n10→∞: Integrating the vertical into our core marketplace, i.e. systematising our core motions like demand generation, supply acquisition, pricing, and launching new markets, with the goal of ultimately firing yourself as CEO to launch another vertical.\n\nFor those who get excited by the idea of building something out of nothing, we think being a vertical owner is the ideal role.\n\nEnjoy extreme ownership over what will hopefully become a large business that delivers an excellent experience to customers. Work on one of the company's primary growth objectives over the next 5+ years. \nGet reps being fast and scrappy in a culture that applauds + rewards creative solutions and crazy ideas, and has a large taste for well-considered risks. Learn through osmosis alongside an excellent team that will push you to perform your best.\nHave the backing of a $1.3B-valued company and all of its resources.\n\nBenefits:\n\n$90k-$200k total compensation\nDo great work that matters for customers who could really use your help.\nMove at the speed of your thinking. \nZero commute. Work wherever you are, globally (but on or around US Pacific Time hours)\n\n*After submitting your application, please check your inbox as well as your spam folder periodically over the next few days for updates.\n ","departments":[{"id":4013034004,"name":"Product","child_ids":[4063555004,4059982004,4037304004,4037303004],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[],"compliance":null,"demographic_questions":null,"questions":[{"description":null,"label":"First Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"first_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Last Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"last_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Email","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"email","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Phone","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"phone","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Resume/CV","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"resume","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"resume_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Cover Letter","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"cover_letter","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"cover_letter_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"LinkedIn Profile","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"question_9777119004","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Website","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"question_9777120004","type":"input_text","values":[]}]}],"location_questions":[]}
