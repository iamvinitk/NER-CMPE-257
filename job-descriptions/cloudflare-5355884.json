Come join us!\nAbout The Role\nWe announced Cloudflare Workers in 2017  — since then it’s played a key role in Cloudflare’s strategy for entering the compute market. Until the launch of Workers, as Cloudflare was ramping up its capabilities in the performance and security spaces, it became clear that developers needed more ways to control the edge than rules engines could support.\nOver the past few years, Workers has grown from a simple functions-as-a-service option into a fully blown full-stack platform. With any application, however, in addition to serverless compute, you need to be able to manage state and connect to data you already have.\nYou’ll be responsible for driving, building and shipping at least two soon-to-be-announced products in the database and data space:\n\nThe first will dramatically improve how developers connect to and query existing databases from Cloudflare Workers, making it even easier to build sophisticated full stack applications with Workers.\nThe second will enable developers to define, execute, and manage multi-step workflows on top of Workers, R2, Queues, and other sources/sinks, making it easier to ingest, process and transform data on the Workers platform.\n\nYou get to join these teams from the ground floor and will be engaging with developers from “week one” as we rapidly innovate and iterate.\nWhat You’ll Do\n\nDrive the strategy, roadmap & represent your products across the organization\nLead projects from ideation through launch, and continuing through ongoing maintenance and support\nDevelop and nurture relationships with engineering and coordinate closely to ensure successful delivery of product\nPartner with other departments such as Product Marketing, Marketing, Community & developer advocacy, Sales, and Customer Support to drive adoption with and gather feedback from customers and prospects\nRuthlessly prioritize across a complex environment of diverse customers, stakeholders and objectives\nRepresent the company externally as needed, including meetings with customers and prospects and analysis\nDelve into market research to drive new investments opportunities\n\nExamples Of Desirable Skills, Knowledge And Experience\nThe ideal candidate is entrepreneurial-minded and thrives in a fast-paced and goal-driven environment. \nYou have outstanding communication and collaboration skills and are able to work with a diverse group, get alignment, and drive the product forward. You are execution focused and emphasize getting things done while paying attention to important details. \n\nProven track record of shipping developer-facing products from ideation to launch\nDeveloper focus — you’ll be working directly, and often be a part of the customers team in helping them get their initial implementation off the ground\nBS/MS in a technology field. \nProfessional product management experience (3-4 years)\nStrong technical abilities. You are intimately familiar with modern software development practices used to build and deploy applications. You are capable of wading into the details & understanding engineering decisions’ impact on the product, but can also drive 30k foot view\nA desire to sweat the details and ship great developer experiences\nExperience using developer tools (such as source-control management tools, CLIs, etc)\nA love for talking to developers at organizations both large and small on a daily basis so that you can build and ship products that solve real problems.\nScripting/programming experience (Javascript, Rust, Go, etc.) and/or experience with query languages.\n\n \n What Makes Cloudflare Special?\nWe’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\nProject Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.\nAthenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\nPath Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\nSound like something you’d like to be a part of?
