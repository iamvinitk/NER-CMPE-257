We dramatically improve lives, by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want, and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.\nAbout Clipboard Health:\nClipboard Health is a post-Series C, extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects, revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote team. We have been named one of YC’s Top Companies for two years running, and have grown 25x across all key metrics in the last 18 months. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities, who can then better serve patients. To learn more about the culture at Clipboard Health, take a look at our culture hub here.About the Role:\nYou would be joining our PM team working with a fast-growing and fast-moving engineering organization. Our product today manages millions of dollars of invoices and pays thousands of participants on both sides of the market. But, we have only scratched the surface in the space of products and experiences we could build, and we need your help.\nWe're looking for a Senior Product Manager that's excited to be a generalist in our rapidly growing Marketplace. You will not be building things with the hope that people need it, but rather filling the desperate needs of our users while innovating in ways they didn't even know they needed. You'll have to be adaptable, learn quickly, and have a deep interest in understanding our business, our users, and our product.\nThis role sits within our Product team. I’d read the following docs from our team prior to applying: the Product Team Standards, Product Team Recruiting, and Product Team Structure. These documents will give you a sense of how we think and what we value. We also have more links about team and company culture on our candidate website.\nBeyond the basics, what will make you successful:\n\nExtreme Ownership: the buck stops with you, no matter what anyone else did or did not do. You're self-reliant, and can get things done in the chaos that is an early-stage startup scaling quickly.\nExtreme Curiosity: you ask \"why\" 3-5 times in a row for the same problem and are excited to tap into your inner archaeologist -- digging and digging and not being satisfied until you truly understand the root cause.\nYou've shipped features in a small PM team, love both the strategy and the details.\n\n*After submitting your application, please check your spam folder periodically over the next few days for updates regarding your application.
