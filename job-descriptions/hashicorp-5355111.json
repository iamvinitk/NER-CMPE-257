Our customers run Consul at large scale, and we support customers that run enterprise versions of Consul on their own infrastructure, as well as building our own cloud management plane.\nThe customers and large community of users of Consul are platform operators, infrastructure engineers, and software developers that encounter novel performance, scaling, and usability challenges that we help them solve.\nConsul started as an infrastructure management tool for service discovery, and has evolved to include a full-featured service mesh. In this role, you’ll be working on the core functionality of the Consul binary, working in Golang, with technologies including gRPC, RAFT, envoy, and SERF. You’ll help rethink and implement product architecture to meet global scale and organizational demands. \nAbout this role\nOur product continues to evolve to meet the needs of our customers, and the service mesh technical ecosystem is expanding with newer architectures such as the use of eBPF for service mesh functionality. We are looking for an experienced engineer experienced with cloud native security and familiarity with operating system level instrumentation (through mechanisms like eBPF). \nHere is what you’ll be doing once you join our team!\nFirst Week:\n\nFamiliarize themselves with the existing codebase of the Consul binary and gain an understanding of its core functionality.\nParticipate in introductory meetings with the team to understand the product's current state and the ongoing development tasks.\nBegin to work on small, well-defined coding tasks and bug fixes to get hands-on experience with the technologies used in the project (golang, gRPC, RAFT, envoy, and SERF).\nCollaborate with team members to get insights into the current product architecture and ongoing development initiatives.\n\nFirst Month:\n\nTake ownership of medium-sized features and enhancements, actively contributing to the core functionality of the Consul binary.\nEngage in design discussions and brainstorming sessions to offer ideas and insights on rethinking and optimizing product architecture for better global scalability and organizational needs.\nGain proficiency in the Consul ecosystem and service mesh capabilities, understanding how they work together to deliver robust infrastructure management solutions.\nCollaborate with other teams to ensure smooth integration and deployment of new features and enhancements.\n\nFirst Three - Six Months:\n\nHelp lead the implementation of major architectural improvements and scalability enhancements in the Consul binary, demonstrating a deep understanding of golang and related technologies (gRPC, RAFT, envoy, and SERF).\nActively participate in code reviews and mentor junior developers, fostering a collaborative and knowledge-sharing environment within the team.\nContribute to improving the overall performance and reliability of Consul \n\nOne Year:\n\nBecome a subject matter expert in Consul and service mesh technologies, guiding the team in making strategic decisions related to product development and architecture.\nPlay a key role in defining the long-term roadmap for Consul, identifying new opportunities for innovation and growth.\nCollaborate with cross-functional teams, including engineering, product, and operations, to continuously enhance Consul's capabilities and address customer needs effectively.\nParticipate in an on-call rotation to resolve critical product issues for customers.\n\nYou may be a good fit for our team if you have...\n\nExperience in a lower-level language like Go.\nPrior experience working in high performance or distributed systems.\nEmpathy for the people operating, learning, teaching and supporting software you write, and consider their experience when making design decisions and performance, security or complexity tradeoffs.\nAwareness of the broader service mesh ecosystem and an interest in contributing to a full-featured product offering while reducing complexity and barriers to adoption for practitioners.\nInterest in building and securing high availability applications using cloud native tools (Load balancers, Route 53, WAF, etc.)\nUnderstanding of networking fundamentals (common protocols and their applications).\nAbility to thrive in ambiguity; complex and fuzzy requirements are more common than clearly defined customer expectations.\nExperience consistently delivering high-value, high-impact projects.\nStrong written and verbal communication.\nExemplify the HashiCorp principles.\n\nWe are committed to building a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills.
