Generate has built a machine learning-powered biomedicines platform with the potential to generate new drugs across a wide range of biologic modalities. This platform represents a potentially fundamental shift in what is possible in the field of biotherapeutic development.\nWe pursue this audacious vision because we believe in the unique and revolutionary power of generative biology to radically transform the lives of billions, with an outsized opportunity for patients in need. We are seeking collaborative, relentless problem solvers that share our passion for impact to join us!\nGenerate was founded in 2018 by Flagship Pioneering and has received over $700 million in funding, providing the resources to rapidly scale the organization. The Company has offices in Somerville and Andover, Massachusetts with over 275 employees.\nThe Role: \nGenerate’s technology platform combines generative AI to design novel proteins with the desired form and function, with aggressive automation to enable their synthesis and structural and functional characterization rapidly and at scale, in an iterative, self-optimizing manner. This “design-make-test-learn” cycle is orchestrated by a state-of-the-art data platform that enables seamless integration of the dry and wet labs and allows all measurements and metadata collected throughout the entire process to be easily captured, recorded, and utilized. Our toolset is anchored in a FAIR database that provides a common source of truth with robust and nimble data modeling capabilities, flexible integrations with third-party software, and a core suite of powerful applications that form the foundation of a unique company with equal parts “bio” and “tech”.\nWe are seeking curious, inventive, motivated, and collaborative software engineers to expand this data platform with new capabilities and achieve new levels of automation, precision, throughput, usability, and resilience.
