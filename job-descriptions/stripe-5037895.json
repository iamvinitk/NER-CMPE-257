We strive to deliver frictionless experiences for all of our users, whether they are an Independent Business, Startup, SMB, or Enterprise and our mission is to provide all Stripe Users with the best support experience possible. Today, Stripe handles over a million support cases per year and processes millions of internal transactions.  We’re going to achieve excellence by thinking of support in a novel, solution-oriented way, and viewing operations as an integral enabler of all of Stripe’s growth.\nStripe has unique operational problems resulting from both our type of scale and the type of businesses we partner with as a result of “growing the GDP of the Internet.”  Stripes leverage understanding of our products, the financial industry and money movement, and our processes to support both internal and external users.
