This role is essential in driving the strategic evolution of our platform and shaping the experiences of our internal platforms, to deliver customer value to millions of users. This role is uniquely situated to impact our two key company bets, by supporting our Sales and Marketing teams in identifying and engaging high quality leads quickly, and by supporting our industry-leading self serve business as we improve the logged-in and logged-out experience for our GTM and Builds teams. \nAs we expand our services to support more teams, we're looking for someone who can enhance our platform's impact and structure.  Partnering with internal stakeholders is absolutely essential to the success of this role and team. It’s through partnership with stakeholders in GTM and Build teams that we achieve the ultimate outcomes (customer and business impact). You’ll implement systems and platforms that set our business up for success for years to come. You’ll need to be outcome-focused from day one. This is a unique opportunity to contribute to a high-functioning team known for rapidly delivering value to our business.\nAbout You\n\n\nThis isn't your first PM rodeo. You have 6+ years of product management experience, where you have experience setting a product strategy, and are hands on with execution. Experience working on a developer platform is preferred.\n\n\nYou own outcomes; you know how to get results. Through collaboration with your team you routinely deliver meaningful results for the business. You share and celebrate and build momentum around positive results. You learn and course correct when you don’t get the results you want.\n\n\nYou communicate the vision and strategy for your team and then make it happen. You work with leadership to refine your team’s vision and strategy and set a 12 month roadmap for how you'll solve those problems. You know how to turn vision into goals, goals into a roadmap, and a roadmap into daily and weekly tasks for your team. You excel at keeping a cross-functional team of designers, researchers, engineers, data analysts, and product marketers working effectively and efficiently.\n\n\nYou care about how platform work drives customer outcomes. You understand the indirect impact your team’s work will drive for the business and customers, and can communicate it clearly to others. You don’t just care about shipping features, but you care about the outcomes they create for our customers and our business. Others would say you have a strong sense of personal responsibility and accountability.\n\n\nYou are data driven. You use data to uncover opportunities and understand what levers to pull to drive business results. You know how to measure the results of your work, test it with real users, and understand its downstream effects. You consider the long term impacts of experiments and look for more than just a short term boost to metrics.\n\n\nYou have ample technical, design, and analytics skills. While you may or may not know how to code, you use your technical context to make better, faster decisions and to minimize technical debt. You understand design patterns and can create functional specs and wireframes. You can use self-serve data exploration tools to support your own decision making. While you'll have resources on your team that are experts in these areas, you can fill in the gaps whenever needed\n\n\nYou are a skilled written communicator. Zapier is a 100% remote team and writing is our primary means of communication. You can use written communication to communicate your team’s vision, roadmap, and progress. You know the right tool for the job whether it’s managing the day-to-day cadence of projects or building cross-company momentum around a project.\n\n\nYou love doing things efficiently. At Zapier, the work you do will have a disproportionate impact on the business. We believe in systems and processes that let us scale our impact to be larger than ourselves.\n\n\nYou advocate for the facts. Before shipping a feature you can identify metrics and user feedback that will help you measure the success of a feature.\n\n\n \nThings You’ll Do\n\n\nCommunicate a vision for the team looking out 3-12 months and build a roadmap to match that vision\n\n\nWork in a small, autonomous, cross-functional team alongside design, engineering, UX research, and data to decide what we build next and execute on that decision\n\n\nTalk with our customers and stakeholders to more deeply understand the problems that we can address for them\n\n\nWork closely with product designers on solutions by writing specs and creating wireframes\n\n\nDevelop a sufficient understanding of technical context to help make better, faster decisions, and work closely with engineers on solutions\n\n\nDig deep on data to understand trends and develop a better picture of the business, the product, or our customers.\n\n\nMeasure and report on the results of your work\n\n\nAnd above all, help customers have the best experience with Zapier as possible.\n\n\n \nZapier Compensation Guiding Principles\nWe believe all Zapiens should be rewarded competitively and equitably, using practices that are simple and transparent.
