On top of full-service payroll, Gusto offers health insurance, 401(k)s, expert HR, and team management tools. Today, Gusto offices in Denver, San Francisco, and New York serve more than 300,000 businesses nationwide.\nOur mission is to create a world where work empowers a better life, and it starts right here at Gusto. That’s why we’re committed to building a collaborative and inclusive workplace, both physically and virtually. Learn more about our Total Rewards philosophy. Head of Benefits Sales reports to our Head of Expansion (responsible for how Gusto maximizes our opportunity to serve our customers through multi-channel interactions). This leader will empower a team of Employee Benefits advisors serving Gusto’s People Platform customers.\nYou will be responsible for building and elevating teams that build relationships with Gusto’s customers to deeply understand their needs for Employee Benefits offerings, guide customers through the selection process across all product lines, and aid customers in buying and configuring what maximizes their value within their budget.\nYou’ll start with a team of ~50 Health Insurance agents selling Gusto’s Small Group Health Insurance to our customers.

While our craft is revenue generation including sales, the way we generate revenue is through identifying optimal offerings custom targeted for our customers. Our role in Expansion specifically is to extend the lifetime value of our customers by maximizing the value they’re getting from us within their willingness to pay and targeting their most strategic need; we think about extending lifetimes through right-sizing offerings as we do about annual contract value or up-sell maximization. \nThis is an inside sales team today and likely to remain that way for at least the next couple years. Our teams leverage the new and existing SMBs using the Gusto People Platform (>300k) and can engage customers at any point in their lifecycle with us. Our motions include bundled sales with our Platform team (new Gusto customers), sales during onboarding, and cross-sell opportunities. At current, we generate leads for our sales teams but also enable them to own a book of potential business.\nThis role is right for you if you have confidence you can empower the team we describe today while charting the course for transformation, and leading us on that path. You will have both input into and accountability for revenue and customer growth targets. \nKey responsibilities\n\nRevenue and customer growth for Gusto Benefits business\nSales team management\nInput into and collaboration enhancing our product offering.
