We hire the best of the best to ensure you’re working with people you can constantly learn from. You’re trusted to get your work done your way while testing the limits of what’s possible and what’s next. We work hard to provide a culture where everyone feels supported, and our employees feel it—their votes helped us become one of Newsweek's Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces in 2023.\nWe also value sports. Not just because of the big wins and highlight-worthy plays, but because of the lasting impact sports can have: the lifelong lessons in teamwork and dedication; the influence of inspiring mentors; the priceless opportunities to play at the next level. Sports can change lives—that’s what we value.\nOur team helps the world see sports differently through products that make it easier to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and do a lot more.  \nReady to join us? \n\nWe’re looking for someone to be our Vice President of Design, to guide, grow and nurture a diverse, global team of designers.

You’ll be responsible for the performance of contributing designers, design managers and directors to create solutions that solve the problems we prioritize.\nProduct vision and alignment. Partner with our VP of Product and our Chief Product Officer to update and communicate the overall product vision, then align efforts to achieve it. You’ll ensure our solutions come together into a cohesive overall experience that’s much more powerful than the sum of its parts.\nProduct and brand design alignment.

We’ll give you the flexibility you need in your work life (e.g., flexible vacation time, company-wide holidays and timeout (meeting-free) days, remote work options and more) so you can enjoy your personal life too.\nGuarantee autonomy. We have an open, honest culture and we trust our people from day one. Your team will support you, but you’ll own your work and have the agency to try new ideas. \nEncourage career growth.
