Notably, it is responsible for 3 tools:\n\nThe A/B Test Framework is designed to facilitate controlled experiments for assessing the impact of changes in user experiences, features, or algorithms. It enables businesses to compare the performance of two or more variants (A and B) in a statistically rigorous manner.\nThe Offline Experiments Framework is developed to allow data scientists and researchers to explore and iterate on machine learning models without directly impacting the live production environment.\nThe Inference Engine for Production is a high-performance system designed to deploy and serve machine learning models at scale in production environments. It ensures low-latency and high-throughput predictions, allowing businesses to leverage models for real-time decision-making.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nWhat will you do?\n \n\nAs a Senior Software Engineer in our Machine Learning Team, your missions will be to:\n\n\nImprove existing ML library & tools allowing to explore and analyze more and more data and provide accurate feedback on the Teads activities.\nCreate, design, develop, test and monitor your code in production autonomously and reliably.\nImplement ML algorithms and models end to end.\nWork together with the data scientists to improve our ML performance.\nMentor other team members to improve their autonomy and Software Engineering skills.\nCollaborate with a variety of teams to develop services from design to production.\nMake sure the software is in good hands by writing, running and automating tests (unit, functional, load...).\nKeep up to date with the latest Machine Learning technologies to make sure we constantly improve our ML system.\n\n\n\n \nWhat will you bring to the team?\n\n\nGood programming abilities.
