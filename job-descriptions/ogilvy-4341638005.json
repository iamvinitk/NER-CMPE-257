Blaze new trails! Compete with the immortals!” \nOn the creative side, you can apply to be Art Director, Copywriter, Designer or Producer intern.  \nWe’re looking for talent who are insatiably curious and observant. Creative problem-solvers and “dot connectors” who love new experiences and sometimes feel like there’s never enough time to for all want to see, read, make, and DO!  \nOgilvy interns get briefed on real client projects competing with ideas against and collaborating with all levels of our team. They act as our junior level, so need to be ready to jump right in, deliver on their craft and prove themselves! Since it’s all real client work, an intern’s project load is based on the actual client work flowing through the office during the 10 weeks of the program.  \nThe goal at the end of our program is to offer full-time or freelance, as long the agency finances and workflow make it possible. Historically, we’ve had a 70% conversion rate. Bottom line, the overall goal is for interns to walk away with real agency and client experience with real work in their books or in their reels. \nWhat We're Looking For: Art Director \nYou think BIG. Yet, your ideas are often simple as you know how to translate them to a social post, an activation or even a product for an impactful solution. You are a team player and know how to partner well. Whether it’s a copywriter or a team of specialists (designers, animators, producers, etc), you able to convey your vision. If the project calls for it, you can be scrappy and resourceful. Ogilvy sets the bar high for taste level, art craft and you are up for the challenge. \nThe Fine Print  \nThe deadline for applications is January 31st, 2024 at 11:59pm ET. Ogilvy Creative Internships are available in Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York City. This year's program will be in a hybrid/in-office setting. This is a full time, paid internship that runs from June to August.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Ogilvy, our people are at the heart of what we do: a creative agency that sparks game-changing ideas across culture and business through collaboration, integrity, and a celebration of self-expression. \nWe believe in building powerful teams with purpose. This means hiring and nurturing talent across all races, ethnicities, religions, abilities, sexual orientation, and gender identities – and we relentlessly curate transformative initiatives that make our commitment to fairness, and equity a reality. \nOur ultimate mission is to leave a positive impact on the world, creating a better future for all, while supporting and uplifting the global communities we serve.  This is central to our mantra of Borderless Creativity.\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\n ","departments":[{"id":4029924005,"name":"Intern/Associate/Early Career","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":4011514005,"name":"Ogilvy Los Angeles","location":"Los Angeles, California, United States","child_ids":[],"parent_id":4011508005}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
