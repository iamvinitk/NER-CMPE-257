Join Formlabs if you want to bring groundbreaking professional 3D printers to the desktop of every designer, engineer, researcher, and artist in the world.\nElectrical engineering at Formlabs involves bringing our hardware to life: we are responsible for developing the hardware and low-level embedded software powering our 3D printers and accessories.\nIn this role, you will:\n\nDesign and build prototypes and production electronic systems, applying a variety of skills: circuit design, PCB layout, embedded firmware development, testing and debugging, and more\nWork in cross-disciplinary teams to design sensing, motion, optical, and thermal systems\nBe a product-focused engineer: develop system requirements, performance specifications, and design decisions based on understanding the needs of our users and the end product goals\nGrow into owning system-level architecture and mentoring other engineers\n\nTo be successful, you should:\n\nHave a track record of designing and building non-trivial electronic systems.  Maybe this means you have years of experience in industry and have shipped multiple products, or maybe it means you have done some complex personal projects.  Either way, outstanding candidates will be able to show off a history of successful projects.\nBe an engineering generalist, even if there are specialties that interest you.  Our team does not assign engineers to technical specialties, but rather asks them to own systems and subsystems.  Outstanding candidates will be very experienced with circuit and PCB design, but also familiar with electromechanical and/or software engineering.\nBe hands-on: engineers on our team are just as at-home in the lab or machine shop as they are on a computer.\nBe motivated by creating great products, and interested in supporting designs throughout the product life cycle from conducting early research to debugging field failures.\n\nSkills we look for: \nThis is a list of some of the things we rely on for our work.  You do not need experience with all of these to be considered.\n\nAnalog circuit design (e.g. ADC and DAC front-ends, signal conditioning, power amplifiers, etc.)\nEmbedded system hardware and firmware development (e.g. microcontroller selection and implementation, high-speed signaling, communication bus and protocol development, etc.)\nMotor and actuator driver design and tuning\nSignal filtering, signal processing, and feedback control systems\nLine voltage power electronics design\nEMC, signal integrity, power integrity, and safety design, validation, and debugging\n\nOur Perks & Benefits:\n\nRobust equity program to build future wealth through RSUs\nComprehensive healthcare coverage (Medical, Dental, Vision)\nLow cost fund options in our 401K and access to advisors \nGenerous paid Parental Leave (up to 16 weeks)\nTenure-based paid Sabbatical Leave (up to 6 weeks)\nFlexible Out of Office Plan – Take time when you need it\nAmple on-site parking & pre-tax commuter benefits\nHealthy on-site lunches, snacks, beverages, & treats\nRegular sponsored professional development opportunities\nMany opt-in culture events across our diverse community\nAnd of course… unlimited 3D prints\n\nWe are an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company.
