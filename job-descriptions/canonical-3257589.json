Whether for enterprise customers deploying systems at scale or users who want security patching for their personal Ubuntu LTS at home, the Ubuntu Pro Client is the command-line tool that manages all these services.\nThe quality and stability of the Ubuntu Pro Client is critically important, since it comes pre-installed on every Ubuntu system. You’ll work with the Ubuntu Server team, alongside major cloud partners and multiple Canonical product teams to develop, test and release improvements to the Pro client. You will also be a voice in communication with our users, ensuring their needs are met.\nThis role requires quality-oriented software engineering in Python and a focus on software interoperability over a vast range of target releases and environments. Excellent Python skills are a key requirement, with previous contributions to open source Python projects being an advantage. The Pro client often interacts with the Ubuntu package management; therefore, experience in configuring apt, and knowledge of deb packaging and general system administration is advantageous in this role.\nApplicants should be passionate about the Ubuntu project and its values and about building tools that are used by millions of people around the world. A personal interest and emphasis on quality, thinking of edge cases, ease of use, documentation, and careful community coordination is important. The Pro client is used at all ranges, from mission-critical environments to hobbyist Ubuntu users; applicants should be ready to work with the whole spectrum of end users and help guide engineering best practices with all of them in mind.\nWhat you’ll do\n\nCollaborate proactively with a distributed team\nWrite high quality code, with unit and functional tests, to create new features\nDebug issues and produce high quality code to fix them\nReview code produced by other engineers\nDiscuss ideas and investigate to find good solutions\nWork from home, with global travel 2 to 4 weeks per year for internal and external events\n\nWho you are\n\nYou love technology and working with brilliant people\nYou are curious, flexible, articulate, and accountable\nYou value soft skills and are passionate, enterprising, thoughtful, and self-motivated\nYou have a Bachelor’s or equivalent in Computer Science, STEM or similar degree\nYou have extensive experience with Python on Linux\nYou have interest in and experience with two or more of the following: Ubuntu Linux systems administration, continuous integration, end-system contract management, Debian packaging, working with public or on premise clouds\nBonus points if you have experience engaging with the open source community\n\nCanonical is proud to foster a workplace free from discrimination. Diversity of experience, perspectives, and background lead to a better environment for our employees and a better platform for our users and customers. This is something we value deeply and we encourage everyone to come be a part of the world of Ubuntu.\n#stack\n#LI-remote\n","departments":[{"id":85345,"name":"Engineering","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":44276,"name":"Home Based - Americas","location":null,"child_ids":[],"parent_id":73277}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
