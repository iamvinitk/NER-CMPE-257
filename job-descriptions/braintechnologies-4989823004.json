Our Human Interface Team (HIT) aims to humanize computing through liberating people from application silos and passive interfaces in old desktop metaphors, propelling them into a new age of intent-aware programs, alongside real-time generative interfaces.We are looking for designers and prototypers to join us in inventing the metaphors and patterns that make up this experience.\nThe Prototyper thinks laterally and finds clarity through making. They are excited about metaphors, and jump at the chance to play with new tools and technologies. They move between engineering and design with fluidity, and value vision over pure craftsmanship. They are flexible about ideas, and uncompromising about doing the right thing.
