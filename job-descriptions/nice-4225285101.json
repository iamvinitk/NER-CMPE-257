We challenge our limits. Constantly. We’re relentless. We’re ambitious. And we make an impact. Our NICErs bring their A game and spend each day turning it into an A+. And if you’re like us, we can offer you the kind of challenge that will light a fire within you.Who We Are \nWe are an energetic group of software builders based in Alkmaar, The Netherlands. We are technically oriented, skilled, social, and international and we foster a dynamic and inclusive culture where all contributions matter. Our offices are comfortable, reachable, and proper work/life balance is important. We are building challenging new products that have impact and we need more of us to make that happen. Obviously, we offer good pay and benefits. \nWhat We Do \nWe create Software Solutions for Financial Market Compliance. In short: we make and sell software that helps prevent and uncover financial fraud within large, global financial institutions. \nGlobal Financial Compliance regulations require that all communications of employees involved with financial transactions are recorded and our NICE Trading Recorder, which is capable of large-scale recording of voice audio (VoIP) and video, enables our customers to be compliant with those regulations. \nOur ambition is to totally rebuild our Trading Recorder. You can help us make our solution consume less resources, move to the cloud, be fault tolerant, distributed, and secure and integrate with on-prem telephony systems but also cloud-based communication products like Microsoft Teams.  \nWhat We Need You to Bring to the Table \n\nA Bachelor or Master’s degree in Computer Science or equivalent \nA minimum of 4 years work experience with a strong software development background \nStrong C#.Net skills \n\n\nAn inherent interest in software development, the latest technologies, frameworks, and development processes, plus an internal drive to create good code and solutions. \nGood / practical English communication skills, both written and spoken, and the ability for direct and forward communication \nA social attitude and good spirits \n\nYour skills and knowledge should at least include some of the following, the more the better: \n\nAzure Cloud concepts like Azure Functions, Azure Resource Manager, etc. \n\n\nKnowledge of distributed systems, WCF, networking & connectivity \nKnowledge of Microservices and/or cloud-native Development \nKnowledge of multithreading, concurrency, and code performance \nKnowledge of application security & encryption \nKnowledge of software design and patterns, DDD, SOLID, etc. \n\nWhat You will be Doing \n\nBe part of a cross functional Scrum team that develops and supports specific components of our end product. You will be working hand in hand with other R&D people. \nBe involved in new feature development and write good, clean code, and develop unit tests to prove your work.  \nOwn the quality of your product, taking full responsibility of all functional – but also non-functional – aspects, like performance, stability, security, and maintainability. \n\nRecruitment workflow \nApart from a first non-technical introduction (in person or via Skype), we will ask candidates to do an assessment. To see if you’re up to the challenge, we can first give you a quick questionnaire/test to see if you are eligible for a proper technical assessment. This technical assessment will be in the form of a console application that you will need to develop on the spot, where the application will need to process some data in a certain way. \nIf we are happy with the results, there will be a third and final interview where you are invited to our office to spend a day. You will meet some of our teams, get a feeling of the atmosphere and be introduced to our product(s) and workflow. Finally, you will speak with our senior leadership team after which we discuss terms/contract.  \n \n About NICE \nNICE Ltd.
