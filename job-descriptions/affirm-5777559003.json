We’re looking for a mid-level content designer (content strategist, UX writer) who shares our passion to revolutionize credit — and have fun doing it — to join our small but mighty team.\nThe content designer in this role will work on high-priority projects as an embedded partner of a product team. You’ll design and iterate on various aspects of the way people pay with Affirm, taking features from discovery all the way through A/B testing. You’ll own and shape the voice of our products, focusing both on longer-term strategy and more tactical day-to-day writing. And you’ll join forces with five other content designers who share feedback, insights, and camaraderie as we build out the content design practice at Affirm.\nTo achieve success in this role, you excel at collaborating with cross-functional partners. You ask insightful questions that uncover gaps and propel teams forward. You move easily between big-picture thinking and fine tuning details. You’re great at communicating, explaining your reasoning, and advocating for the user. And, of course, you’re an excellent writer!\nWhat You'll Do\n\nWork cross-functionally with PMs, designers, researchers, and engineers at all stages of the product development process — from ideas to optimizations.\nContribute your expertise to product strategy and vision (not just “how it should look,” but “what should we build?”).\nDevelop first principles at the org, team, and project levels. Help create artifacts to scale our team’s reach beyond our embedded teams.\nShape product experiences through information architecture, content hierarchy, usability principles, accessibility, and other best practices.\nWork closely with stellar legal and compliance partners to finetune language where needed.\nWrite human UX content that is clear, consistent, concise, and engaging.\nCreate and collaborate on user flows, communications (like texts and emails), test prototypes, research questions, and more.\nBring your keen sense of usability to participate in design sprints for new products, helping define flows and features.\nAdvance brand voice across our products.\n\nWhat We Look For\n\n2 years of UX writing experience, both for web and native products.\nA BA or BS in a related field (English, journalism, communications, human factors), or equivalent experience.\nA demonstrated portfolio of your work showing strategic thinking and successful shipping of in-app/web consumer experiences in a fast-paced environment. (Required)\nExperience and interest in financial services is a plus.\nYou are deeply fluent in all-around writing skills — you’re a language nerd who lives and breathes UX writing.\nYou think strategically — you’re interested in working on complex systems and frame your work around business objectives.\nYou work independently with confidence and authority — and with minimal oversight.\nYou love to collaborate and advocate for the user and for content design.\nYou're creative — you’re a great storyteller with the ability to persuade.\nYou value and enjoy doing user research.\nYou advocate for a content-first approach to design!\n\n\n\nLocation - Remote Canada\n\n#LI-Remote\n\nAffirm is proud to be a remote-first company!
