Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company. \nWe realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us! \nAbout the Role\nYou will work as part of our core engineering team in London which builds the Cloudflare system running in 160+ cities around the world. Your work will focus on building robust, secure and high performance distributed systems. We are a small engineering team operating at a massive scale, so what you do will have a huge influence. We work in agile teams, so you will be supported by colleagues, and collaborate with other teams around the company.\nIn the Data Team, you would be responsible for crafting, building, and scaling one of the biggest global data pipelines to overcome network delays and partitions. Using Go, Kafka, ClickHouse, and PostgreSQL to store and analyse in excess of 25 million events per second (and growing fast).\nIf you joined us, your first 6 months could look like this: You start with a structured onboarding during which you get up-to-speed with the systems that move data around Cloudflare. You lead a project which uses our firehose of over 25 million events per second to build systems which provide deeper insight into the ways our customers use Cloudflare. You expose these insights to our customers. You share the knowledge gained with your colleagues. You take ownership of these systems, ensuring that they are secure, scalable, robust, and observable. You talk about this work at one of our weekly company talks, put together a post for the company blog, and engage with engineers on other teams who have exciting ideas about a way to take the work further.What Makes Cloudflare Special?\nWe’re not just a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company. We’re a highly ambitious, large-scale technology company with a soul. Fundamental to our mission to help build a better Internet is protecting the free and open Internet.\nProject Galileo: We equip politically and artistically important organizations and journalists with powerful tools to defend themselves against attacks that would otherwise censor their work, technology already used by Cloudflare’s enterprise customers--at no cost.\nAthenian Project: We created Athenian Project to ensure that state and local governments have the highest level of protection and reliability for free, so that their constituents have access to election information and voter registration.\nPath Forward Partnership: Since 2016, we have partnered with Path Forward, a nonprofit organization, to create 16-week positions for mid-career professionals who want to get back to the workplace after taking time off to care for a child, parent, or loved one.\n1.1.1.1: We released 1.1.1.1 to help fix the foundation of the Internet by building a faster, more secure and privacy-centric public DNS resolver. This is available publicly for everyone to use - it is the first consumer-focused service Cloudflare has ever released. Here’s the deal - we don’t store client IP addresses never, ever. We will continue to abide by our privacy commitment and ensure that no user data is sold to advertisers or used to target consumers.\nSound like something you’d like to be a part of?
