Our goal is to make open source easier, more reliable and more secure for deployment and development. We strive to be the provider of ‘most software to most companies’. To deliver on that ambition, our engineers are carefully selected from the applicants across the globe. We select for brilliance and motivation to take open source to the next level. Our engineering managers help teams achieve more than they realised they could, and feel proud of the result.\nWe believe that Engineering Managers should be outstanding developers themselves. They should be completely at home reviewing a patch or a software design spec. They are trusted engineers who understand the importance of a whole-team effort in creating great products, and who enjoy seeing colleagues develop. They should contribute code themselves to set the standard for coding, but know that the code they write is far less significant than their ability to shape the whole team’s direction, focus and delivery. We grow management skills, and train engineers who are interested in soft skills to be managers.\nA typical first-level software engineering team is based in a single time zone such as EMEA or Americas or APAC, with an Engineering Manager and a Senior Engineer dedicated to a single product, who work as a team to shape the roadmap, technical strategy, code, documentation and community engagement. They are both capable of coding, and are both leaders comfortable assigning work and maintaining expectations of delivery. They will both be expected to take management training at Canonical so they speak the same language when it comes to team behaviours, habits, routines, norms and standards, but they focus on different sides of the problem.\nAn Engineering Manager is responsible for line management and career guidance. The ability to develop engineering talent, to represent your team and product from a technical perspective, and to drive collaboration with other teams and customers are all critical to success in this role.\nWe have open manager roles across a wide range of engineering domains, including: \n\nPython and Golang\nC / C++ / Rust\nData infrastructure\nHTML / CSS / JavaScript / Typescript / React\nFlutter\nDistro packaging and systems\nSAAS and web microservices\nKernel\nServers\nGraphics, Browser and Desktop  \nSilicon enablement and embedded devices\nProduct Security\n\nIf your domain of expertise isn’t listed above, yet you feel it’s relevant to Canonical, then feel free to apply anyway.

We revisit compensation annually (and more often for graduates and associates) to ensure we recognise outstanding performance. In addition to base pay, we offer a performance-driven annual bonus. We provide all team members with additional benefits, which reflect our values and ideals. We balance our programs to meet local needs and ensure fairness globally.\n\nDistributed work environment with twice-yearly team sprints in person\nPersonal learning and development budget of USD 2,000 per year\nAnnual compensation review\nRecognition rewards\nAnnual holiday leave\nMaternity and paternity leave\nEmployee Assistance Programme\nOpportunity to travel to new locations to meet colleagues\nPriority Pass, and travel upgrades for long haul company events\n\nAbout Canonical\nCanonical is a pioneering tech firm at the forefront of the global move to open source.
