Visit careers.klaviyo.com to see how we empower creators to own their own destiny.Klaviyo has a unique take on the Solution Architect role. While most companies hire SAs to give demos, fill out questionnaires, and explain complicated setups, that makes us yawn. We built a product that anyone can use (just ask our more than 100,000 customers) and we have smart sales reps and customer success colleagues who are true product experts. \nSo what do we do? We work directly with a small percentage of prospective and existing customers alongside our sales, customer success, and parternships teams as customer-facing engineers that accelerate complex deals and customer value. We use these engagements as an opportunity to learn, prototype, and ship meaningful improvements to the Klaviyo experience. We look for interesting problems and aim for solutions that are extensible and reusable (e.g. see our publication Solutions @ Klaviyo).\nWhen a solution calls for it, we like writing code to solve problems. For example, we’ve built Chrome plugins, custom functions for importing data via API into Google Sheets, and demo environments that continuously receive data in real-time. In short, we are a team of entrepreneurial builders that believes simple things should be simple and complex things should be possible.\nIf you get energized by solving real-world customer problems, prototyping solutions, and communicating technical concepts - all within the context of actual customer engagements - this could be for you. What you’ll get in return is the opportunity to be part of an extremely high-performing, strategically-important team that works at the exciting intersection of engineering, sales, and customer success.\nHow You’ll Make a Difference:\n\nBecome a complete expert in the Klaviyo app, from understanding the data pipelines and code base of our integrations to understanding technical tradeoffs between different implementations.\nOffer your expertise on how best to accomplish use-cases.\nSolve problems manually first and then either automate future solutions and/or collaborate with Product and Engineering to proactively improve the Klaviyo product and customer experience over time.\nBe the go-to internal technical resource, educating team members as well as prospects/customers to provide a consistently positive Klaviyo experience.\nDevelop and maintain personal relationships during engagements across many different customers simultaneously.\nGrease the wheels and shorten the sales cycle - act with urgency and precision to give users best in class support in troubleshooting issues as they arise.\nEffectively balance a range of core functions in support of constantly striving to help increase the output and efficiency of Klaviyo.\n\nWhat skills you bring:\n\nProven ability to work in customer-facing roles and familiarity with SaaS sales processes\n2+ years of applied experience with web development languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, Javascript) and REST APIs.\nSome applied experience with a web app development framework (e.g. React, Node, Angular, Vue, etc.) and/or with a general-purpose programming language (e.g. Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.).\nProven ability to learn new technical concepts.\nHighly analytical thought process and are an excellent communicator with the capability to articulate tradeoffs and persuade technical stakeholders.\nAn interest in - and ability to - hustle in a fast-paced environment. Someone who makes and meets commitments.\nKnowledge of the eCommerce, martech and ESP domains is a strong plus\nEligibility to work in Australia without restriction\nThe pay range for this role is listed below.
