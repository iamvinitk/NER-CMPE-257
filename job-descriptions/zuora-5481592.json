This is how we coined the term, the Subscription Economy®.\nToday, we see others evangelizing this term, and building entire communities around it. The Subscription Economy isn’t (and never was) just about subscription business models but, direct, recurring relationships with customers through any business model. Subscriptions were only just scratching the surface and now, the market recognizes the Subscription Economy for what it truly is-a relationship-centric economy. Companies have realized that the path to growth going forward is to establish direct, digital relationships with their customers, and to nurture and monetize these relationships through an ever growing set of digital services.\nThrough our industry leading technology and expertise, Zuora helps more than 1,000 companies around the world, including BMC Software, Box, Caterpillar, General Motors, Penske Media Corporation, Schneider Electric, Siemens and Zoom, nurture and monetize direct, digital subscriber relationships.
