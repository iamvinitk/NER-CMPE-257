We partner with the best minds and most experienced teams across industry and academia, bringing together the knowledge, experience, and skills required to navigate our critical path.\nMission\nWe want to mine space resources from near-Earth asteroids to provide abundant, sustainable energy and resources in space and for Earth.\nVision \n\n\nAsteroid mining has lived at the intersection of scientific research and popular culture for decades, with as many academic papers published as there are books, TV shows and movies about it.\nAccess to resources, with its finite nature and disparate distribution, plays an essential part in the geopolitical web of power and wealth. It has defined economic growth to such an extent that we have been using them as primary demarcation lines and identifiers in our history, from the stone to bronze and iron age to our current silicon age.\nBut our resources-driven growth faces a massive existential challenge, with climate change, ecosystem degradation and resource depletion demanding a complete reset. Humanity needs to shift global transportation, manufacturing, construction and energy onto a sustainable path.\nExpanding beyond the Kármán line is where we believe transformative future growth and innovation will be found. Recent missions by NASA (OSIRIS-REx & DART) and JAXA (Hayabusa2) have firmly pushed the idea of using space resources from academic research into commercial opportunity.\nWe believe the Regolith Age, powered by abundant space resources, is an inevitability that we can accelerate.\n\nWe value these principles:\n\nDiversity of thought. We believe that different perspectives drive better results. We aim to build diverse teams and a diverse company.\nOwnership, feedback and accountability. Ideas improve through collaboration, discussion and iteration. Decisions don’t follow the same pattern and revert to the mean when made in a group. We aim to have clear ownership, accountability for results and autonomy to deliver. \nNo silos. We build cross-functional teams to be able to deliver on our goals. There are no predefined lanes for people to operate in, information is pushed out across all teams to make sure we benefit from cross-pollination.\nHigh talent bar, no assholes. We optimize for potential and a growth mindset. We value experience, but only when balanced with self-awareness and first principles thinking.\nSmall is beautiful. The best results as well as the best work experience come from a small team of talented people working towards a common goal.\n\n\n\nApply today!\nWe continue to look for future talent to join our team. If you'd like to be considered for future job opportunities with our Karman+ team, we invite you to complete our General Application. Come work with us...\n\nWe are crazy ambitious but the timing is right. Be part of the team looking to make it happen.\nWe are looking to build things to put in space quickly.\nWe emphasize creativity and innovation and resources are available to support good ideas.\nJoin a team of people working toward the same ambitious goal.\nWe are an engaging team looking to empower our teammates.\nYou can have a share in the company value creation.\n\nFollow us on LinkedIn to stay tuned on upcoming roles with Karman+. \nIf you know someone who'd be a great addition to our team, please encourage them to apply for this role or for our General Application.
