This capsule currently delivers critical science, cargo and crew safely to and from International Space Station, but further iterations and new designs will likely be necessary to extend humankind's reach to the moon, Mars, and beyond. This program includes roles in: Analysis, Avionics, Build Engineering, Integration & Test Engineering, Life Support Systems, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Engineering, Propulsion Engineering, Structures Design & Engineering, Supply Chain Engineering and more.\nFALCON: The Falcon program tackles space exploration’s toughest problems through the ongoing development of our reusable launch vehicles, Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy. These vehicles are currently responsible for delivering commercial, national security, and NASA satellites into orbit, as well as supply critical science, supplies, and crew to the International Space Station. This program includes roles in: Analysis, Avionics, Build Engineering, Components Engineering, Integration & Test Engineering, Launch Site Operations & Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Engineering, Propulsion Engineering, Recovery Engineering, Structures Design & Engineering, Supply Chain Engineering and more.\nSTARLINK: At SpaceX, we’re leveraging our experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy Starlink, the world’s most advanced broadband internet system. Starlink is the world’s largest satellite constellation and is providing fast, reliable internet to 1M+ users worldwide. We design, build, test, and operate all parts of the system – thousands of satellites, consumer receivers that allow users to connect within minutes of unboxing, and the software that brings it all together. This program includes roles in: Analysis, Automation & Controls, Avionics, Components Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Integration & Test Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Engineering, Operations Engineering, Structures Design & Engineering, Supply Chain Engineering and more.\nSTARSHIELD - Starshield leverages SpaceX’s Starlink technology and launch capability to support national security efforts. While Starlink is designed for consumer and commercial use, Starshield is designed for government use, with an initial focus on earth observation, communications, and hosted payloads. As an intern on the Starshield team, you will be working on advanced development programs in support of U.S. National Security. This program includes roles in: Avionics, Build Engineering, Components Engineering, Integration & Test Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Engineering, Mechanical Design & Engineering, Structures Engineering, and more.\nSTARSHIP: The Starship spacecraft and Super Heavy rocket – collectively referred to as Starship – represent a fully reusable transportation system designed to carry both crew and cargo to Earth orbit, the Moon, Mars and beyond. As the most powerful launch system ever developed, Starship will be able to carry up to 100 people on long-duration, interplanetary flights. Starship will also enable satellite delivery, the development of a Moon base and point-to-point transport here on Earth. This program includes roles in: Analysis, Automation & Controls, Avionics, Build Engineering, Civil Engineering, Components Engineering, Industrial Engineering, Launch Site Operations & Engineering, Manufacturing Engineering, Materials Engineering, Propulsion Engineering, Structures Design & Engineering, Supply Chain Engineering, Test Engineering and more.","departments":[{"id":4013000002,"name":"Internships","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":4000990002,"name":"Hawthorne, CA","location":"Hawthorne, CA, United States","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
