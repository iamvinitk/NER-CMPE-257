Founded by CRISPR inventors and leading molecular engineers Benjamin Oakes, Brett Staahl, David Savage, and Jennifer Doudna, Scribe is overcoming the limitations of current genome editing technologies by developing custom engineered enzymes and delivery modalities as part of a proprietary, evergreen CRISPR by Design™ platform for CRISPR-based genetic medicine.\nWe are seeking a Scientist I/II with experience in biophysical chemistry. The candidate will join the Process Sciences analytical team to characterize the higher order structure, aggregation, oligomerization, stoichiometry, and folding of sgRNA and ribonucleoproteins (RNP) for its CRISPR by Design™ platform. The ideal candidate should have a good understanding and strong knowledge of biochemistry, structure, and biophysical methods to probe the solution-state structure, folding, or interactions of biomolecules. We are seeking experienced, enthusiastic, creative, and highly motivated individuals who are comfortable working in a fast-paced entrepreneurial CMC environment.\n \nKey Responsibilities:\n\nDevelopment, qualification, and implementation of biophysical methods to probe folding and higher-order structure (aggregation, oligomerization) of RNA and RNPs to assess potential stability-indicating or quality attributes for characterization, stability, and early CMC support across multiple early-stage programs\nPhysicochemical characterization of differential CRISPR-Cas RNP complexes and folded sgRNAs by size exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS)\nFunctional characterization (in vitro DNA cleavage) of differential CRISPR-Cas RNP complexes by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or anion exchange (AEX) chromatography\nExplore the use of Biolayer Interferometry (BLI) analysis of the sgRNA binding activity of Cas proteins and/or target binding activity of CRISPR-Cas effector complexes\nExplore the potential to measure folded states of sgRNA and RNPs by native electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry and/or atmospheric ion mobility\nPerform analytical method development and qualification of suitable assays, perform assays, and report results in appropriate formats (Benching, analytical report, and presentations)\nWork collaboratively in a multi-disciplinary environment with Process Science and Research teams \nData analysis using statistical software’s such as GraphPad PRISM, JMP, SoftMax Pro etc.,\nMaintain detailed records of experimental methods and data in electronic laboratory notebook (Benching). Participate in authoring reports, test methods, SOPs, and tech transfer\n\n\nRequired Skills and Background:\n\nPhD with 0-5 years of experience, or MS with 5-8 years of experience in an academic/ industry setting. Degree in Chemistry, Biochemistry, Chemical Engineering, Bioengineering, Pharmaceutical Sciences, or related discipline\nExcellent oral and written communication skills\nEffective organizational and time management skills\nStrong focus and attention to detail\nAbility to work both independently and collaboratively in a fast-paced, interdisciplinary research team\n\n \nPreferred Skills and Background:\n\nFamiliarity with CRISPR technologies and therapeutic approaches\nUnderstanding of FDA, ICH and EP or other regulatory agency guidance associated with analytical methods\nThe ideal candidate has prior experience with biophysical methods to characterize RNA, RNP, or other protein:protein interactions \n\n \nSalary will be commensurate with experience. We will provide an intellectually stimulating, collegial and fast-paced environment. If you are ready to engineer the future of therapeutics, then we are excited to hear from you!
