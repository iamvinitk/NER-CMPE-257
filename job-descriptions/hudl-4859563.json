We hire the best of the best to ensure you’re working with people you can constantly learn from. You’re trusted to get your work done your way while testing the limits of what’s possible and what’s next. We work hard to provide a culture where everyone feels supported, and our employees feel it—their votes helped us become one of Newsweek's Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces in 2023.\nWe also value sports. Not just because of the big wins and highlight-worthy plays, but because of the lasting impact sports can have: the lifelong lessons in teamwork and dedication; the influence of inspiring mentors; the priceless opportunities to play at the next level. Sports can change lives—that’s what we value.\nOur team helps the world see sports differently through products that make it easier to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and do a lot more.  \nReady to join us?\nYour Role\nWe’re looking for an Account Executive to support market development of net new or acquisition revenue, and expand current accounts. This role will be concentrated on U.S. and Canadian clubs and high schools. The large majority of your sales will take place in online demos and over the phone, but you'll also occasionally travel to your territory to thrive on the front lines (one of our company values) with prospects.\n \nTo succeed, you’ll:\n\nOwn a sales cycle. You’ll collaborate with athletic directors and coaches to ensure their schools and teams have what they need to develop and improve.\nClose sales on the phone and through online demos. We believe the more calls and demos you make, the more sales you make.\nWork across multiple sports. Whether it’s global football or American football, you’ll know how every team can benefit from video analysis. Understanding our customer personas regardless of sport is extremely important.\n\nAt Hudl, we pair Account Executives (who focus on growing acquisition revenue) with Customer Success Managers (who focus on engagement, implementation and renewal revenue). This helps us ensure we're growing across all sports, product verticals and locations, in addition to supporting customers' journeys with Hudl.\nThis role requires two days in the office per week, so we're only considering candidates who live within a commuting distance of our offices in Lincoln or Omaha Nebraska. \nMust-Haves\n\nExperience. You have at least two years of business-to-business sales experience and have a consistent track record of achieving/exceeding goals. \nMotivation. You love to beat your own records, expect the best from yourself, and always want to keep improving.\nOrganizational skills. You own your territory by mapping out your days with the prospects you’re going to contact, and you’re comfortable working in a remote environment.\n\nNice-to-Haves\n\nSaaS experience. If you’ve spent time selling software-as-a-service, that’s a plus.\nKnowledgeable about sports. Being an athlete, coach or administrator in club or high school sports isn’t necessary but would help you connect with our user base.  \nPrior Salesforce usage. We use it for our CRM software, but don’t worry if you’re not familiar with it yet. \n\nOur Role\n\nChampion work-life harmony. We’ll give you the flexibility you need in your work life (e.g., flexible vacation time, company-wide holidays and timeout (meeting-free) days, remote work options and more) so you can enjoy your personal life too.\nGuarantee autonomy. We have an open, honest culture and we trust our people from day one. Your team will support you, but you’ll own your work and have the agency to try new ideas. \nEncourage career growth. We’re lifelong learners who encourage professional development. We’ll give you tons of resources and opportunities to keep growing.\nProvide an environment to help you succeed. We've invested in our offices, designing incredible spaces with our employees in mind. But whether you’re at the office or working remotely, we’ll provide you the tech stack and hardware to do your best work.\nSupport your mental and physical health. We care about our employees’ wellbeing. Our Employee Assistance Program, employee resource groups and fitness partner Peerfit have you covered.\nCover your medical insurance. We have options to make sure you (and your dependents) are covered. Including vision, dental, fertility healthcare and family forming benefits.\nContribute to your 401(K). Yep, that’s free money. We’ll match up to 4% of your own contribution.\n\nInterview Process\n\n1st Interview: 30-minute call with a recruiter\n2nd Interview: 60-minute video call with a Sales Manager \nProject: Will give you an idea of this role's day-to-day responsibilities\nFinal Interview at our headquarters or via Zoom\n\n60-minute panel with three Sales Managers\n\nInclusion at Hudl\nHudl is an equal opportunity employer. Through our actions, behaviors and attitude, we’ll create an environment where everyone, no matter their differences, feels like they belong. We offer resources to ensure our employees feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work, including employee resource groups and communities. But we recognize there’s ongoing work to be done, which is why we track our efforts and commitments in annual inclusion reports. We also know imposter syndrome is real and the confidence gap can get in the way of meeting spectacular candidates. Please don’t hesitate to apply—we’d love to hear from you.\nPrivacy Policy\nHudl Applicant and Candidate Privacy Policy","departments":[{"id":68747,"name":"Sales Competitive HS","child_ids":[],"parent_id":69039}],"offices":[{"id":2610,"name":"USA - Nebraska - Lincoln Office","location":"600 P Street, Lincoln, NE, United States","child_ids":[],"parent_id":83416}],"compliance":null,"demographic_questions":{"header":"Voluntary self-identification, gender and race","description":"<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We'd like to know how well we're doing to ensure diversity, equity and inclusion in our recruitment processes.
