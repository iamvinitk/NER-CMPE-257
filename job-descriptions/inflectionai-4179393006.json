Our studio is made up of the world's leading AI developers, creative designers, writers and innovators working together in a deeply multidisciplinary style to create a brand new class of digital experiences. \nWhere We Work\nWe work in a hybrid model. During the week we’re in the office on a flexible basis, often a few days per week. We are currently hiring in Palo Alto and London, although we do sometimes make exceptions. \nWe work on a 6 week cycle. Every 7th week, we convene together in person as a company to brainstorm, bond and build. \nHow We Work\nWe value excellence and ownership. Our organizational structure focuses on individual responsibilities rather than management hierarchies. Everyone is expected to lead by doing. We are big believers in the unreasonable effectiveness of highly talented Individual Contributors who are given all the resources, space and ownership to move fast and deliver outstanding results. \nTeamwork and generosity are at our core. Our culture celebrates positive challenges, asking questions, learning and actively supporting one another. This mentality of shared respect and purposeful teamwork is key to our success. We equally value all technical and non-technical contributions.\nConstructive disagreement is essential. We appreciate when team members challenge assumptions, put forward new ideas, or encourage us to move faster or slower. Openness, honesty and kindness make us great.\nFeedback is our ground truth. We have a tight feedback loop between the user experience and our AI creation process. Quantitative and qualitative data drives our priorities. This goes for internal culture too. Everyone has ownership and visibility into key decisions and progress.\nWriting creates accountability. Whether on internal communication tools or in team memos, we are strong communicators with a special focus on the written word. \nWe deeply value time to reset outside of work. We encourage one another to constantly take time to recharge and always focus on maintaining a healthy work-life balance. \nEngineering at Inflection\nWe are a vertically integrated AI studio.

We continuously explore and exploit, creating new and perfecting existing techniques and solutions. User feedback is our North Star.\nOur Benefits\nWe offer generous benefits to ensure a positive, safe, inclusive and inspiring work environment for all Inflectioneers.\n\nPhysical office space in Palo Alto and London, along with reimbursements for work from home expenses and co-working spaces\nUnlimited paid time off \nParental leave and flexibility for all parents and caregivers\nGenerous medical, dental and vision plans for US employees\nCompliance with country-specific benefits for non-US employees\nVisa sponsorship for new hires\nAvenues for personal growth such as coaching, conference attendance, or specific trainings\n\nDiversity & Inclusion\nWe are building personal AIs that we hope will serve everyone.
