But we are more than a platform—we are the creators and stewards of the Experience Management category serving over 18K clients globally. Building a category takes grit, determination, and a disdain for convention—but most of all it requires close-knit, high-functioning teams with an unwavering dedication to serving our customers.When you join one of our teams, you’ll be part of a nimble group that’s empowered to set aggressive goals and move fast to achieve them.

Join over 6,000 people across the globe who think that’s work worth doing.\n\nWhy We Have This Role\nSolutions Architects engage early in the project lifecycle where the customer is just beginning to define the vision, and often lean on the Solutions Architect to imagine what is possible and determine if it’s feasible.
