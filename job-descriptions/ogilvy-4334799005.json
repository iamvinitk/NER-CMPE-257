It’s always been a brand built on superior care and difference (the beauty bar technically isn’t a soap; it uses a different formula to standard soaps with built-in moisturisers). Since its launch it has grown to become one of the world’s leading beauty and personal care brands, encompassing body care, haircare, and deodorants, plus the dedicated Dove Men+ Care and Baby Dove ranges, with Dove now sold in more than 150 countries around the world.\nDove is a brand with an unparallel communications history. The Ogilvy-Dove partnership dates to the late 1950s, with David Ogilvy coining the famous ‘1/4 moisturising cream’ line that is still used today. Dove has always communicated differently, with its ads throughout the 1960s and 1970s departing from the standard beauty ads of the day to speak through the powerful testimonials and recommendations of ‘real women’.\nOgilvy developed the iconic ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’ for Dove in 2004, with the mission to make beauty a source of confidence, not anxiety for all women. The ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’ includes many iconic adverts such as ‘Tick Box’, ‘Evolution’ and ‘Sketches’ (which has now been viewed more than 10m times on YouTube alone). As a recognition of Dove’s rich communications history, in 2019 Dove was named as one of Effie’s top 5 brands of the last 50 years, alongside Apple IBM, Mastercard and Nike.\nBut the Dove story doesn’t end here. As more and more brands seek to put purpose at their heart, the challenge is for Dove to maintain its lead as the world’s most meaningful beauty brand. We’re rising to that opportunity at Ogilvy by developing a new brand platform and by creating ever more exciting, challenging, and provocative creative campaigns, finding new ways to interact with women all over the world about the issues that really matter to them, and driving real and lasting social change.\n \nAbout this role: \nAs an Account Director at Ogilvy, you are leading large projects with ease, and forging strong relationships with the Unilever Brand Managers and Brand Directors.
