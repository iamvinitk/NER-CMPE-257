Team Description:  \n \nJoin the Brain Interfaces team and be part of a team of remarkable and driven engineers accelerating our pathway to human ready brain-computer interfaces. We are looking for versatile engineers who are interested in architecting and implementing elegant software solutions and who thrive with the autonomy to propose creative approaches to problems. You will be responsible for writing software to interact with Neuralink’s implant, as well as building systems for manufacturing and testing the device. You will have the opportunity to work directly with an exceptional team of mechanical, electrical, and firmware engineers on a small team that moves quickly.\nNeuralink strives to be, as much as possible, a meritocratic environment: we require honest and transparent communication to ensure the best ideas win out, and we believe the best solutions emerge and the best teams are created when you assemble high-performing individuals and allow them to engage in rigorous and thoughtful inquiry. We want to work with exceptional people, and, to the extent that you excel, we want you to take on more responsibility and help all of us succeed. If this speaks to you, come join us.\nAbout you:\n\nYou find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.\nYou deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting design, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering reliable solutions. (Our ultimate aim is to help people; the “right” solution doesn’t always achieve that.)\nYou are mission-driven and goal-oriented in your approach to solving problems.\nYou feel a sense of urgency to get things done sooner rather than later—because there is so much we, as people, can contribute to the world and accomplish in this life, it’s a shame to waste time.\nYou are resourceful, flexible, and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.\n\n \nKey qualifications: \n \n\nMust have prior internship experience \nExperience in Python, C++, and C (don’t get hung up on this—being an exceptional software engineer matters above all)\nExperience (and comfortable) with the Linux/Unix systems and command line\nEvidence of exceptional ability in engineering, mathematics, or computer science\nStrong understanding of engineering first principles\nStrong intuition for what matters in a production system (vs. research-grade)\n\nPay Transparency:\nBased on California law, the following details are for California individuals only:California hourly rate:$35/hr USDFor full-time employees, your compensation package will include two major components: salary and equity. Guidance on salary for this role will be determined according to the level you enter the organization (with the ability to gain more through time as you contribute). \n \nFull-Time Employees are eligible for equity and benefits listed below in addition.\n\nWhat we offer:\n\nAn opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and most talented experts from different fields. \nGrowth potential. We rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact. \nExcellent medical, dental, and vision insurance through a PPO plan; parental leave.\nFlexible time off + paid holidays.\nEquity + 401(k) plan.\nCommuter Benefits.\nMeals provided.\n\n\nMultiple studies have found that a higher percentage of women and BIPOC candidates won't apply if they don't meet every listed qualification. Neuralink values candidates of all backgrounds. If you find yourself excited by our mission but you don't check every box in the description, we encourage you to apply anyway!\nNeuralink provides equal opportunity in all of our employment practices to all qualified employees and applicants without regard to race, color, religion, gender, national origin, age, disability, marital status, military status, genetic information or any other category protected by federal, state and local laws.
