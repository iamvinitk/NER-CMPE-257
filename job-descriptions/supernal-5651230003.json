We are designing a completely new electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft tailored to the mobility needs of future cities. This allows passengers a seamless intermodal journey that safely transports them to their final destination. We fuse research in autonomy, robotics, aviation and services to define a new category of mobility for the world’s communities. We believe in creative thinking and collaboration to help build a better mobility experience for everyone, improving people’s ability to move – whether for work or play.\nWhat we do: \nThe Lead Flight Control Systems CLAW Engineer serves as a key member of the Flight Controls team, driving the development and deployment of algorithms for the electric vertical and take-off landing (eVTOL) vehicle. This role will participate in critical analysis of aircraft stability, construct the control architecture, and implement rigorous testing of control law implementation and dynamics. From desktop simulations to the systems integration lab, the Lead Engineer will be an integral part of the prototyping and certification process, ensuring compliance with ARP 4754A and DO-178C regulations.\nThis role supports development of the control laws system requirements, and aids in the definition of the system best practices and philosophy. This role also works closely with multi-functional engineering teams to design and test control laws.\nWhat you can do:\n\nDesign and implement flight control algorithms for a VTOL aircraft with a novel configuration\nMastery in implementing classical and modern control law\nOversee and conduct trade studies between different design considerations and control schemes\nDefine and coordinate control system architecture and response types for an aircraft that might change configuration between flight regimes\nConduct stability and control related analyses in time and frequency domain\nCollaborate with the systems engineering and other engineering specialty teams to define requirements related to the flight control system and system safety\nMay require up to 10% of domestic and international travel\nOther duties as assigned\n\nWhat you can contribute:\n\nBachelor’s degree in aerospace or relevant engineering field required\nMinimum of ten (10) years of experience in flight control algorithm design for rotary-wing and/or fixed-wing Fly-By-Wire aircraft systems (an equivalent combination of education and experience may be considered)\nStrong experience in analyzing flight dynamic modes\nExperience with actuator and motor control loops\nExperience with mixing and blending of control surface commands\nExperience with flight testing and requirement definition\nExperience with sensor processing and Kalman filter design\nExperience with different modes of aircraft flight, including vertical lift\nExperience building control laws for remotely-controlled aircraft could be beneficial\nExperience with system identification and optimization tools (CIFER, CONDUIT)\nExperience in math model development of a physical system\nFamiliarity with DO-178B/C, DO-160, DO-254, ARP 4754A, ARP 4761, and DO-331\nExpertise in MathWorks® tools for control algorithm development\nFamiliarity with FAA part 23/25/27/29 or other certification experience\nFamiliarity with aircraft handling quality requirements\nExcellent verbal and written communication skills\nProactive delivery of communication and follow up\nExcellent organizational skills and attention to detail\nMust have the ability to independently plan, prioritize, and accomplish work within time constraints\n\nYou may also be able to contribute:\n\nExperience in C++ preferred\nMaster’s or PhD preferred\n\nAny offer of employment is conditioned upon the successful completion of a background check.
