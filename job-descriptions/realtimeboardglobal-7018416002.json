Miro's workspace is integrated with more than 130 other applications including Jira, Azure DevOps, Asana, Zoom, Slack, and Teams, many of which offer two-way integrations and can be dynamically updated directly from Miro.\nMiro enables organizations to accelerate time to market and ensure continuous alignment with customer needs and company strategy. In most organizations, Miro is used by product development teams looking for a new, better way to drive innovation. However, we see more teams including marketing, sales, management consulting, architecture, creative design, and HR that are increasingly applying innovation methodologies such as design thinking and agile practices and adopting Miro for this work.\nCheck out more about life at Miro: \n\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/@lifeatmiro\nBlog: https://miro.com/careers/life-at-miro/all/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/wearemiro/\n\n\nAt Miro, we strive to create and foster an environment of belonging and collaboration across cultural differences.
