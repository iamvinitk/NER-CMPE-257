With this, we will reduce cognitive overhead and therefore accelerate the delivery of applications and the pace at which they produce business value.\nThis is often referred to as the golden path or the paved road.\nWhat You'll Do:\n\nDeveloping and improving the build and ship part of “you own it, you run it”.\nIntegrate GitHub Codespaces into Aura development\nWork with ArgoCD and build the future of how we deliver software to production.\nWork with Backstage and our internal developer portal.\nWork on Component Excellence and how we measure quality of our components and motive and drive component improvements.\nBuild and improve tooling to enable engineers, for example:\n\nScaffolding, make it easier to create components\nProvide testing frameworks to make it easier to test components\nProvide a better Continuous Delivery platform with Argo Rollouts to enable testing in production\n\n\nWork on and improve the Kubernetes as a Control-Plane, to enable engineers to control all of their resources through Kubernetes management lifecycles.Why Join Neo4j?\n\nNeo4j is, without question, the most popular graph database in the world.
