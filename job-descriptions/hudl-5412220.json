We hire the best of the best to ensure you’re working with people you can constantly learn from. You’re trusted to get your work done your way while testing the limits of what’s possible and what’s next. We work hard to provide a culture where everyone feels supported, and our employees feel it—their votes helped us become one of Newsweek's Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces in 2023.\nWe also value sports. Not just because of the big wins and highlight-worthy plays, but because of the lasting impact sports can have: the lifelong lessons in teamwork and dedication; the influence of inspiring mentors; the priceless opportunities to play at the next level. Sports can change lives—that’s what we value.\nOur team helps the world see sports differently through products that make it easier to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and do a lot more.  \nReady to join us?\nYour Role\nWe’re looking for a Senior Web Developer to join our in-house marketing agency. This role is responsible for driving the design, implementation, optimization and maintenance of Hudl’s customer-facing web properties, and for providing technical guidance to the marketing team.\nYou’ll primarily work on building and maintaining customer journeys implemented within our content management system (CraftCMS) using HTML, CSS, Javascript and Twig, but with opportunities for working in other stacks as needed. Through close collaboration with our brand designers, content producers and marketing managers, you’ll: plan and implement site architecture and UX/UI changes; administer general updates; create landing pages; conduct audits for bug fixes and address them; and support various marketing campaigns. You’ll also track and report on site metrics, and be responsible for providing recommendations that improve the overall customer experience and increase conversion ratesFor this role, we're currently considering candidates who live within a commuting distance of our office in Lincoln, NE. But with our flexible work policy, there aren't any current requirements for the number of days you come to the office.\nMust-Haves\n\nExperienced. You’ve spent 5+ years planning and executing front and backend web projects.\nKnowledgeable. You understand fundamental web standards and technologies (not just frameworks!) and know how to apply them to problems. You have expert proficiency with HTML and CSS, and have demonstrated experience writing modern javascript for the browser.\nAttention to detail—both technical and visual. You know the details matter! You have experience building responsive layouts based on mockups from a designer.\nBusiness-savvy. You’re comfortable pushing back when the business side makes unrealistic requests, and understand how to align technical details with business goals.\nOrganized. Documentation and knowledge-sharing is a primary function of this role.\nAnalytical. No decision is purely subjective. You provide data for your solutions.\n\nNice-to-Haves\n\nFamiliar with content management systems. You understand the concepts and processes required to manage a large content managed website.\nExperience with internationalization on the web. Hudl is a global business and our website needs to serve a global customer. Past experience with localization processes and best practices is a plus.\nWeb development in an advertising/marketing context. Attention to the visual experience and brand consistency is key. You’re probably not a designer, but you can easily create new work based on an existing look-and-feel.\n\nOur Role\n\nChampion work-life harmony. We’ll give you the flexibility you need in your work life (e.g., flexible vacation time, company-wide holidays and timeout (meeting-free) days, remote work options and more) so you can enjoy your personal life too.\nGuarantee autonomy. We have an open, honest culture and we trust our people from day one. Your team will support you, but you’ll own your work and have the agency to try new ideas. \nEncourage career growth. We’re lifelong learners who encourage professional development. We’ll give you tons of resources and opportunities to keep growing.\nProvide an environment to help you succeed. We've invested in our offices, designing incredible spaces with our employees in mind. But whether you’re at the office or working remotely, we’ll provide you the tech stack and hardware to do your best work.\nSupport your mental and physical health. We care about our employees’ wellbeing. Our Employee Assistance Program, employee resource groups and fitness partner Peerfit have you covered.\nCover your medical insurance. We have multiple plans to pick from to ensure you’ll have the coverage you (and your dependents) want, including vision, dental, fertility healthcare and family forming benefits.\nContribute to your 401(K). Yep, that’s free money. We’ll match up to 4% of your own contribution.\nInclusion at Hudl\nHudl is an equal opportunity employer. Through our actions, behaviors and attitude, we’ll create an environment where everyone, no matter their differences, feels like they belong. We offer resources to ensure our employees feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work, including employee resource groups and communities. But we recognize there’s ongoing work to be done, which is why we track our efforts and commitments in annual inclusion reports. We also know imposter syndrome is real and the confidence gap can get in the way of meeting spectacular candidates.
