The mobile team is staffed with Android, iOS and full-stack engineers as well as a Designer and Product manager. We own problems end to end, which means you will work with all those people as we build new products.

We are open to change, adopting the right tools for the job but we are pragmatic in how we use our time and what risks we are willing to take. \nThe mobile team collaborates with the other teams in Intercom as we bring a range of features to the mobile SDKs.

Our strong test coverage allows us to safely move fast without breaking existing features.\nWhat will I be doing? üöÄ\n\n\nCollaborate on shaping our mobile strategy and roadmap across all Intercom offerings.\n\n\nOwning problems end to end, working with design, product, backend engineers as well as other Android and iOS engineers to solve the biggest problems for our customers. We believe in autonomous teams and that best mobile products are created from close collaboration across the stack, without barriers.\n\n\nHelp us make the right tradeoffs while being pragmatic and building for the long term.\n\n\nDevelop technical plans and contribute to our technical architecture as we grow.\n\n\nWe move fast at Intercom but building a mobile SDK demands a very high quality bar. You will build long-standing, well tested and reliable Android code.\n\n\nWhat skills do I need? üìñ\n\n\n4+ years experience building mobile products on Android.\n\n\nKnowledge of Java or Kotlin, Android APIs and design patterns.\n\n\nYou‚Äôve published one or more apps in the Play Store.\n\n\nExperience collaborating directly with product teams and designers, and the ability to deliver value to customers or users. Engineers at Intercom are pragmatists who work closely with others on cross-disciplinary teams.\n\n\nHow will I be supported? \n\n\nYou‚Äôll report directly to an Engineering Manager who will start you off with a great onboarding plan.\n\n\nYou‚Äôll embed immediately into our Mobile team and receive dedicated peer support from one of our engineers.\n\n\nWe invest heavily in our Engineers, supporting individual career development through training and coaching.\n\n\nBenefits üòç\nWe are a well treated bunch, with awesome benefits!
