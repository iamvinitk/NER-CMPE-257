Our robot, Digit, is the first to be sold into workplaces across the globe. Our team is differentiated by its expertise in imagining, engineering, and delivering robots with advanced mobility, dexterity, intelligence, and efficiency -- robots specifically designed to work alongside people, in spaces built for people. Every day, we break through engineering challenges and invent new solutions and capabilities that will one day make robots commonplace and approachable. This work is our passion and our responsibility: our mission is to make businesses more productive and people’s lives more fulfilling.About the Team\nAgility Robotics is building a small skunkworks team to execute product-focused R&D programs that explore and de-risk novel mechatronic concepts for our advanced bipedal multi-purpose robotic platform. The team will work directly with the VP of Innovation (Pras Velagapudi) and the Chief Robot Officer (Jonathan Hurst), who both have a long history of novel robot development.\nThe Innovation group is becoming an independent group from engineering, shielded from the daily fires of product deployment, focused on solutions for the next versions of our Digit robots and forward-looking innovation.  \nAbout The Role\nAs a Senior Mechanical Design Engineer, you will work with experienced roboticists to design and create proof-of-concept electromechanical subsystems for the Digit robots. You will work closely with the innovation team to propose and scope concepts and projects; do initial analysis; design in CREO to bring initial concept development to prototyping, testing, and preparing for hand-off to the engineering organization for refinement into production. You will work with engineers across the organization, as we pull in specific expertise as needed for each project. You will lead rapid iteration and improvement through our technology development process to continuously innovate and advance our highly dynamic, human-centric, multi-purpose robot technology.\nAbout The Work\n\nLead the design of prototype components, subsystems, and proofs-of-concept for technologies relevant to Digit, Agility’s human-centric, multi-purpose robot. (e.g. actuator design, transmission, novel tendon transmission, arm and gripper prototype, Leg/foot prototype, BLDC motor design)\nDevelop requirements and concepts with representatives from multiple disciplines (electrical, mechanical, industrial design, software, test, manufacturing etc.)\nCreate subsystem CAD and ensure quality among other contributors\nPerform engineering calculations to support design choices\nSupport definition of structural and thermal analyses\nLead cross-functional design reviews\nReview other parts and subsystems\nWrite test protocols for your subsystem\nSupport procurement team in component sourcing\nLead root cause investigations\nSupport process development and documentation for mechanical team\nParticipate in hiring activities for the hardware department\nMentor more junior mechanical engineers\nTrack status of tasks and document design work using Jira and Confluence \nDeliver quality results within defined schedules, budgets and priorities\n\nAbout You\nYou love designing cool mechanisms, are a great communicator, and enjoy working with a highly capable team. You are a creative engineer who builds systems from the ground up, quickly; with great intuition for the right technical path; a passion for robotics, dynamics, and things that move; and the quantitative skills for up-front analysis to achieve a successful prototype.\n\nSelf-motivated, high-performing team player\nBSME + 8 years relevant industry experience OR MSME + 6 years relevant industry experience OR PhD + 3 years relevant industry experience\nExpertise in electromechanical system design (mechanisms, actuators, thermal management, sensor/electronics integration and/or structures)\nFabrication experience, and a portfolio of projects (college competitions up through high-tech industry experience)\nProficient in mechanical CAD software (PTC Creo, Windchill PLM preferred, Experience with CAD surfacing and cable routing preferred)\nProficient at creating mechanical drawings and GD&T\nExperience with test design, implementation and reporting\nBenefits \n\nCompetitive Compensation Package\n100% Company Paid Disability, Life, Health, Dental & Vision Insurance (for AR employees)\nEmployer Matched Retirement Plan\nFive Weeks of Paid Time Off Annually\nPaid Parental Leave\nTuition Reimbursement\nEmployee Referral Bonus Program\nRelocation Assistance (for certain roles)\nStock Options (for certain roles)\nA culture that encourages flexible work schedules\nA culture that embraces individuality and authenticity\n\nAgility Robotics is committed to a work environment in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity.
