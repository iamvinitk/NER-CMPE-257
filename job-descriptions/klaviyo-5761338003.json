We believe everyone deserves a fair shot at success and appreciate the experiences each person brings beyond the traditional job requirements. If you’re a close but not exact match with the description, we hope you’ll still consider applying. Want to learn more about life at Klaviyo? Visit careers.klaviyo.com to see how we empower creators to own their own destiny.\nKlaviyo has a unique take on the Solution Architect role. While most companies hire SAs to give demos, fill out questionnaires, and explain complicated setups, that makes us yawn. We built a product that anyone can use (just ask our more than 100,000 customers) and we have smart sales reps and customer success colleagues who are true product experts. \nSo what do we do? We work directly with a small percentage of prospective customers, alongside our sales & customer success teams, as customer-facing engineers to accelerate complex deals and customer value. We use these engagements as an opportunity to learn, prototype, and ship meaningful improvements to the Klaviyo experience. We look for interesting problems and aim for solutions that are extensible and reusable.\n \nA few things our team has recently built as part of sales and customer engagements include: new productized integrations; modular ETL packages; a library of custom functions for importing data via API into Google Sheets; demo environments that continuously receive data in real-time; and an internal app to organize competitive intelligence. In short, we are problem-solvers and builders. We believe easy things should be easy and hard things should be possible. \n \nIf you’re an entrepreneurial engineer that gets excited by imagining new features, prototyping solutions, and incubating new technologies - all within the context of actual customer engagements - this could be for you. What you’ll get in return is the opportunity to be part of an extremely high-performing, strategically-important team that works at the exciting intersection of engineering, sales, and customer success.How You’ll Make a Difference:\n\nBecome a complete expert in the Klaviyo app, from understanding the data pipelines and code base of our integrations to understanding technical tradeoffs between different implementations.\nSolve problems manually first and then either automate future solutions and/or collaborate with Product and Engineering to proactively improve the Klaviyo product and customer experience over time.\nBe the go-to internal technical resource, educating team members as well as prospects/customers to provide a consistently positive Klaviyo experience.\nDevelop and maintain personal relationships during engagements across many different customers simultaneously.\nAct with urgency and precision to give users best in class support in troubleshooting issues as they arise.\nEffectively balance a range of core functions in support of constantly striving to help increase the output and efficiency of Klaviyo.\n\nWho You Are:\n\n4+ years of applied experience with web development languages (e.g. HTML, CSS, Javascript) and REST APIs. Ideally this is within a pre-sales type of role and / or working in partnership with client facing teams.\nApplied experience with a general-purpose programming language (e.g. Python, Ruby, PHP, etc.).\nProven ability to learn new programming languages and technical concepts.\nHighly analytical thought process and are an excellent communicator with the capability to persuade technical stakeholders.\nAn interest in - and ability to - hustle in a fast-paced environment.
