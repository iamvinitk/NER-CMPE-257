Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nResearch at Stripe\nStripe’s mission is to increase the GDP of the internet and expand economic access globally. We’re designing tools and infrastructure to help our users start, run, and scale an online business from anywhere in the world. We believe there are too many barriers to doing business on the internet, and that opportunities are not equally distributed throughout the world. We also think building and growing a business online is a problem rooted in code, language, and design—not finance.\nThat’s where you come in: we’re looking for an experienced UX Researcher to join our growing UX Research team to partner with product teams to build world-class product experiences in a creative environment. You will also collaborate with a diverse group of researchers from many disciplines, skills, backgrounds, and specialties.\nAbout UX Research and the role\nThe UX Research team is part of Stripe’s Design team and works across many types of brand and product initiatives at Stripe to more effectively and efficiently deliver products and experiences that fulfill user needs. And since Stripe’s main audience is other people who build products, we agonize over and take pride in crafting user-friendly and user-focused experiences. \nIn addition to conducting primary research, we also enable other Stripes (engineers, product managers, designers, operations, etc.) to learn and apply research skills to global problems. You will play a role in shaping how we build research as a core competency across Stripe and define how we put users first when conducting research.\nWho you are\nAs a UX Researcher, you will be dedicated to the Accounts and Orgs team and collaborate directly with product, engineering, sales, and design teams.
