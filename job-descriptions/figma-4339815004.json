Born on the Web, Figma helps entire product teams brainstorm, design and build better products — from start to finish. Whether it’s consolidating tools, simplifying workflows, or collaborating across teams and time zones, Figma makes the design process faster, more efficient, and fun while keeping everyone on the same page. From great products to long-lasting companies, we believe that nothing great is made alone—come make with us!FigJam is an online whiteboard for teams to ideate and brainstorm together. Purpose-built for every stage of your end-to-end workflows, FigJam makes everything from whiteboarding to design sprints easier and more fun — whether you’re working alone or collaborating with your extended team, no matter where in the world they’re based.\n \nThis is Figma’s newest standalone product offering and is still in its earliest stages of opportunity; we’ll look to you to help own and shape product direction as we explore this greenfield space. You’ll use our unique technical stack to solve complex technical challenges and help launch some of FigJam’s most compelling forthcoming features.\n \nWe use C++ (we call it fullscreen) for the main canvas working space in FigJam, which compiles to WebAssembly to run in the browser and enables our powerful performance and rendering capability - an industry setting standard for what is possible on the web. We use React and Typescript for our UI, where things like our toolbar and context menus live; it works in close concert with the WebAssembly layer, so we can offer a responsive, interactive, and delightful user experience. Livegraph is Figma’s own implementation of GraphQL, which helps us query data from our databases efficiently. We occasionally dabble in REST APIs and our infrastructure code as well!\n \nProfessional experience with these languages and technologies is not a requirement. We encourage candidates to use the programming language that they’re most comfortable with during interviews—new hires will be onboarded onto our codebase on the job.\n \nFigma is a highly collaborative organization and most projects are owned by small teams of 2-3 people. You’ll form strong relationships and collaborate with engineers outside of your immediate team, designers, leaders, PMs, data scientists, and user researchers to both scale our product efforts and invest in each other’s learning, growth, and success. We strive to foster an inclusive culture that promotes equity and belonging, and use our engineering values to guide how we work together: communicate early and often, lift your team, focus on craftsmanship, and prioritize impact. Learn more about our values and how we developed them here.\n \nThis is a full-time role that can be held from one of our US hubs or remotely in the United States.\nWhat you’ll do at Figma:\nIn 30 days, you will…\n\nBe paired with an onboarding buddy on your team who will help you ramp in our stack and get to know Figma. You’ll move from starter tasks and codebase contributions aligned to your existing experience to areas that present growth opportunities and learning.\nBegin contributing to feature workstreams organized around weekly roadmap goals and longer-term milestones in partnership with engineers and designers - we don’t operate in silos.\nGet to know Figmates across the company via team-building activities (like our weekly Zoom hang, where we celebrate wins, play games, and have even made literal, delicious fig jam together), participating in our Give a Fig philanthropy efforts, joining one of our Employee Resource Groups, or creating something amazing during Maker Week.\n\n \nIn 60 days, you will…\n\nShip a feature to production, which might include things like a UX update to our delightful toolbar.\nParticipate in design reviews, technical reviews, and give feedback during user testing sessions.\nCraft performance objectives with your manager that align with company priorities and career development opportunities.\n\n \nIn 90 days (and beyond), you will…\n\nWork closely with cross-functional partners to drive a new feature from conception to execution to shipping, like Open Sessions, which allows users to join your FigJam files for up to 24 hours at a time without log-ins or friction.\nContribute to org-wide initiatives like new hire onboarding, developing interview processes, and Diversity, Equity, and Belonging efforts.\nImprove engineering processes around testing, reliability, and quality.\nBe a mentor and provide thoughtful feedback to your peers, and benefit from strong personal and professional mentorship opportunities yourself.\n\n\nWe’d love to hear from you if you have:\n\n\nAt least 3+ years* of professional experience shipping features or products as a fullstack developer, ideally in one of our core technical domains (but not required!)\n\nWorking on or leading development on a large web application.\nWriting C++ (or related languages such as Objective C or C) in a user-facing context (e.g. gaming, native applications).\n\nProactive communication skills and a willingness to work directly with designers, product managers, and other collaborators to build performant, fun, accessible experiences for users.\nExperience in and a desire to teach fellow engineers through pairing, code review, and in-the-moment feedback.\nA dedication to building a supportive and inclusive environment with and for your teammates.\n\nOne of Figma’s values is to Grow as you go. We believe in hiring smart, curious people who are excited to learn and develop their skills. If you’re excited about this role but your past experience doesn’t align perfectly with the points outlined in the job description, we encourage you to apply anyway.
