Security is integral to the success of the business, as we secure the data of our Merchants, Customers, Dashers, and Employees, while also protecting privacy. Our teams span several capabilities, including application security, cloud security, corporate security, security detection engineering, security platform engineering, and security threat response. We also have GRC teams dedicated to maturing our processes to maintain compliance and mitigate security risks.
