Help us build a new layer of protection that will give enterprises the same level of security for their cloud offerings as Abnormal Security’s industry leading products do in the email security space. \n \nWe’re looking to add a Backend Engineer to our team of world class engineers. The individual in this role will shape and elevate our Notable Events team while working closely within the Behavioral Security Products division. This role straddles the line of velocity and excellence. \n \nAs a Backend Engineer of the Notable Events team, you will: \n\nBuild and maintain high-throughput, low-latency systems that process 100s of millions of events per day to enable detection to identify notable events\nEnhance our frameworks for improving detection efficiency and effectiveness\nProvide operational support to maintain a high level of system uptime and performance\nCreate a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates\n\n \nYou are someone who wants to make an impact. You are passionate about solving customer problems and have built up a base of skills in backend and distributed systems development to do so. You want to apply those skills on a problem that leaves the world in a better place. \n \nWe are a scrappy team: we are building a new product from scratch - this means you should be comfortable with a level of uncertainty beyond what you’d find at a more mature company or even a more mature team at Abnormal. Not every project will come with a well defined PRD - that’s expected and we expect this engineer to go dig in and figure out what to do. This also means occasionally we’ll ask you to do things that may not strictly fit the role of a “backend engineer” - it might mean jumping on a customer call, or digging in to help fix a frontend bug. \n \nWe are also not only a remote team, but a very distributed team, as such you will need to have excellent communication skills across both verbal and written mediums. You will need to be just as comfortable on a zoom call as writing a 1 pager project proposal to be shared across the team for technical feedback. \n \nIn this job, you will bring these skills\n \nSkills/Experience - Required: \n\nExperience working with building and operating distributed systems and services\n3-5 Years of overall software engineering experience\nExperience with Python\n\n \nSkills - Nice to have: \n\n2+ years Golang\n\n \nTech Stack:\n\nLanguage: Python, Golang\nPlatform: AWS\nFramework: Django, Spark\nStorage / Data Pipelines: Postgres, Redis, ElasticSearch, Kafka, Parquet\n\n \nRole Responsibilities\n\nBuild and maintain high-throughput, low-latency systems that process 100s of millions of events per day to enable detection to identify notable events\nEnhance our frameworks for improving detection efficiency and effectiveness\nProvide operational support to maintain a high level of system uptime and performance\nCreate a magical work environment with colleagues and memorable interview process for candidates\n\n \n \n#LI-NT1\nAt Abnormal Security certain roles are eligible for a bonus, restricted stock units (RSUs), and benefits.
