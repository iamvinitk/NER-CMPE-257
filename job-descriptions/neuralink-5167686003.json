You will execute and improve design transfer and manufacturing processes, learning the existing frameworks and building the trust of the engineering teams. The ideal candidate is someone with a technical background with strong writing skills, with the ability to parse important details from ambiguity, and who is comfortable working alongside design engineers and manufacturing lines. You will help the nascent products in the pipeline efficiently complete medical-grade design and manufacturing processes and, by doing so, ensure the highest standard of product reliability and performance across the team. \nJob Responsibilities:\n\nSupport the progress of an engineering change, including progress toward verifications and validations, working closely with Quality Systems (QS) to understand any updates to validation requirements and working closely with design engineers on the change description and on the design transfer activities.\nUpdate the team’s general system docs for each block of changes (ex. each FDA supplement), such as the System Description, and “Intended Use, Normal Use, Essential Performance, and Reasonable Misuse”\nHelp engineers execute the correct design transfer activities, and learn the system by doing. Manage the Design History File (DHF), DMR, DHR review, etc. for the team’s parts. Organize the official reviews; ensuring that document control & signature processes happen correctly. Create and release the “Design Transfer” elements like product BOMs, manufacturing procedures, tooling, and packaging (with support from design engineers as needed).\nBridge between engineering design, manufacturing, and Quality Systems (QS). Work with QS to understand the current status of validations and adoptions and help designers select the correct validation strategies. Work with QS to help engineers make manufacturing workflows that maintain an extremely high standard for product safety and performance.\nAs you learn the pain points, implement solutions that make these processes faster and more reliable for engineers to execute.\n\nAbout You:\n\nYou find large challenges exciting and enjoy discovering and defining problems as much as solving them.\nYou deliver. You may enjoy thoughtful conversations about problems and perfecting designs, but in the end, you know that what matters is delivering a manufacturable solution that works every time.\nYou are a cross-disciplinary team member. You are excited to work with and learn from software, mechanical, electrical, materials, biological engineers, and neuroscientists. You are comfortable communicating across teams.\nResourceful, flexible and adaptable; no task is too big or too small.\n\nKey Qualifications: \n\nBachelor’s Degree in science or engineering, or equivalent in experience and ability.\nStrong understanding of engineering first principles.\nExcellent verbal and written communication.\nRelentless attention to quality.\nExperience making any processes more efficient\n\nPreferred Qualifications: \n\n1+ years of experience with rigorous design control processes in safety-critical applications. (for example, in medical, automotive, aerospace, nuclear industries)\n1+ years of experience working in a cleanroom production environment.\nFamiliarity with hardware, software, and firmware development and production.\nExperience with medical device best practices and regulatory requirements for FDA and/or international bodies. For example, Design Controls, GMP, GCP.\nTrack record of successfully implementing process improvements leading to increased efficiency and reliability.\nExperience with risk analysis.\nPay Transparency:\nBased on California law, the following details are for California individuals only:California base salary range:  $93,350—$144,616 USDFor full-time employees, your compensation package will include two major components: salary and equity. Guidance on salary for this role will be determined according to the level you enter the organization (with the ability to gain more through time as you contribute). \n \nFull-Time Employees are eligible for equity and benefits listed below in addition.\n\nWhat we offer:\n\nAn opportunity to change the world and work with some of the smartest and most talented experts from different fields. \nGrowth potential. We rapidly advance team members who have an outsized impact. \nExcellent medical, dental, and vision insurance through a PPO plan; parental leave.\nFlexible time off + paid holidays.\nEquity + 401(k) plan.\nCommuter Benefits.\nMeals provided.\n\n\nMultiple studies have found that a higher percentage of women and BIPOC candidates won't apply if they don't meet every listed qualification.
