We’ve built a free web browser that blocks creepy ads and trackers by default, a private search engine with a truly independent index, a browser-native crypto wallet, and a private ad network (opt-in!) that directly rewards you for your attention. And we’re just getting started. Already 50 million people have switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Millions more switch every month.\nThe internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is fighting back. Join us!\nSummary\nBrave is proud to offer summer internships for Ph.D.-level students that involve working on ground-breaking technologies that make the web faster, safer, and more private for millions of people worldwide. Brave’s mission is also to change the way advertising is done on the web.\nYou should be ready to tackle hard problems that involve building software that will be shipped to millions of people worldwide.
