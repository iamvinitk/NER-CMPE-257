We see a lot of value in teams being co-located but also support a hybrid work environment - and therefore we support Wisers working from home 2 days a week. In addition, we also offer working remotely for up to 3 months every year.\nYour Mission: \n\nWise has already pioneered new ways for people to transfer money across borders and currencies. Our customers can also manage their hard-earned money with the world’s first platform to offer true multi-currency banking. At this point, each month we help hundreds of thousands of customers send money to and from Latin America. \nIn this role, your first mission will be making Wise even cheaper in Brazil by integrating us directly into the payment systems. You will also be responsible for the product Wise offers to consumers in Brazil. \nYou’ll be directly responsible for making decisions on where and how Wise deepens its products in Brazil. You’ll look at existing products, identifying opportunities to improve them while also thinking about use cases Wise doesn’t serve yet (such as saving and investing). You’ll walk in the shoes of our customers and define what a great localised product looks like, building a seamless, intuitive product for different use cases.\nYour role will primarily be as an individual contributor - executing within the Brazil team to offer great products to customers.\nYou will own the plans and roadmap for these domains and work with the engineering, banking, compliance and operational teams to deliver them.\nOutside of Brazil, you will also participate in the wider strategy and plans of Wise’s expansion in emerging markets.\n\n \n\nThis role will give you the opportunity to:\n\nDirectly contribute to our mission to make money without borders the new normal in Latin America.\nBuild world-class products with a world-class product and engineering team: The role is a unique opportunity to build innovative, state-of-the-art solutions. It’s also an opportunity to work with some of the smartest product thinkers in the world.\nMake a real impact on people's lives - by building world-class products you will be able to make a change on real people and how they relate to international transfers - how they pay, hold and receive funds internationally - helping people and businesses to make the best use of their money across the region.\nMake autonomous decisions - we believe people are most empowered when they can act autonomously. So rather than telling you what to do, you’ll work with your team to create a vision of your own. Of course, you can always gather feedback from smart, curious people across Wise but you’ll have the freedom to make your own calls\nLead a highly cross functional team  - You will build alignment and conviction across a highly cross functional team on the path forward for consumers in the Brazilian market. \n\n\nA couple of skills that might describe you as a PM:\n\nYou’ve built products at scale – You’ve worked on a product with thousands or even millions of customers. You’re able to navigate the product and organisational complexity of a product at scale.\nYou're able to use English as the primary work language. Wisers come from 90+ nationalities whose native language is not English, so what matters is that you can understand and make yourself understood in English. You are also comfortable conversing with external stakeholders in either Portuguese or Spanish.\nYou have experience with financial services - You have worked on a large scale financial services product (inside or outside of the Finance industry), getting into details of the customer experience and the technical implementation.\nYou have experience taking existing productions from functional to delightful. You can figure out which parts of our products are letting customers down and come up with solutions to improve them.\nYou’re hands on – You thrive in a cross functional team. You are able to operate at many levels of detail, flipping between executing as an individual contributor and influencing the wider team. You have a superpower as an individual contributor, whether it’s going deep on data analysis, design, planning or engaging stakeholders.\nYou’re data-driven – You are able to self-serve with data, and use it to both identify opportunities and measure your impact. You can get the entire company behind you by telling stories with data.\nYou have fresh ideas - You don’t accept the status quo, but are interested in solving problems in novel ways. You are able to communicate the impact of those ideas and formulate plans to implement them\n\n\nOur Offer\n\nBase salary: $160k - $220k gross / year base (based on experience & interview outcomes)\nRestricted Stock Units (RSUs): https://www.wise.jobs/2021/03/26/the-true-value-of-stock-in-a-high-growth-company-like-wise/ \nNumerous amount of best in class benefits: https://www.wise.jobs/2021/11/10/benefits-in-our-austin-office\nFun fact: we're 2023's Austin BuiltIn Best Award winner for Best Places to Work and Best Large Places to Work\n\nWe’re people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We want to work with the best people, no matter their background. So if you’re passionate about learning new things and keen to join our mission, you’ll fit right in.\nAlso, where and what you studied isn't important to us. If you’ve got great experience, the right skills for the role and you’re great at articulating your thinking, we’d like to hear from you.\n#LI-AY #LI-HybridWe're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We believe teams are strongest when they are diverse, equitable and inclusive.
