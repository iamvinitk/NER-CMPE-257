Please keep reading...\nYou’ve probably heard the following statistic: Most male applicants only meet 60% of the qualifications, while women and other marginalized candidates only apply if they meet 100% of the qualifications. If you think you have what it takes but don’t meet every single point in the job description, please apply! \nWe believe that historically, many processes disproportionately hurt the most marginalized communities in society- including people of color, working-class backgrounds, women and LGBTQ people. Centering these communities at our core is pivotal for any successful organization and a value we uphold steadfastly.  Therefore, Udacity strongly encourages applications from all communities and backgrounds. \nUdacity is proud to be an Equal Employment Opportunity employer. Please read our blog post for “6 Reasons Why Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Workplace Exists”\nLast, but certainly not least…\nUdacity is committed to creating economic empowerment and a more diverse and equitable world. We believe that the unique contributions of all Udacians is the driver of our success. To ensure that our products and culture continue to incorporate everyone’s perspectives and experience we never discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, ancestry, disability, medical condition (including genetic information), age, veteran status or military status, or any other basis protected by federal, state or local laws.\nAs part of our ongoing work to build more diverse teams at Udacity, when applying, you will be asked to complete a voluntary self-identification survey. This survey is anonymous, we are unable to connect your application with your survey responses. Please complete this voluntary survey as we utilize the data for diversity measures in terms of gender and ethnic background in both our candidates and our Udacians. We consider this data seriously and appreciate your willingness to complete this step in the process, if you choose to do so.\nLearn more about Udacity's Values\n \nStudents First - Better Together - Entrepreneurial - Data Driven - Candid and Direct - Talent Obsessed\n \nUdacity's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy\n ","departments":[{"id":4066083002,"name":"Session Lead","child_ids":[],"parent_id":4057086002}],"offices":[{"id":4000330002,"name":"Remote","location":"Remote","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"compliance":null,"demographic_questions":null,"questions":[{"description":null,"label":"First Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"first_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Last Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"last_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Email","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"email","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Phone","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"phone","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Resume/CV","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"resume","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"resume_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Cover Letter","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"cover_letter","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"cover_letter_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"How did you hear about this job?","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"question_19570749002[]","type":"multi_value_multi_select","values":[{"label":"Udacity Jobs Page","value":92128886002},{"label":"LinkedIn","value":92128887002},{"label":"Glassdoor","value":92128888002},{"label":"Indeed","value":92128889002},{"label":"Instagram","value":92128890002},{"label":"Facebook","value":92128891002},{"label":"Twitter","value":92128892002},{"label":"Udacity Employee Referral","value":92128893002},{"label":"Event/Meet Up","value":92128894002},{"label":"Other","value":92128895002}]}]},{"description":null,"label":"LinkedIn Profile","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"question_19570750002","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Udacity Privacy Policy","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"question_19570751002[]","type":"multi_value_multi_select","values":[{"label":"By submitting your application for employment, in addition to agreeing to Udacity's Terms of Use and Privacy Policy (https://www.udacity.com/legal/privacy), you hereby consent to the collection and use of the information and supporting documents you provide us throughout the application process, including, but not limited to, personal information (\"Application Information\").
