You are open to receiving and giving feedback.\nTeam player: You are naturally collaborative and enjoy helping your teammates out.\nDependable customer commitment: You understand the importance of reliability for keeping customers connected- and are available to work 9am-6pm ET and participate in weekend on-call rotations as part of the support team's extended coverage.\n\nThe estimated base salary range for this role is $80,000 - $115,000 per year.
