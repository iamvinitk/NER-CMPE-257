Third-parties make that ecosystem better – from tools that provide analytics, data visualization, dynamic pricing, and more – and our flexible, open  platform makes those integrations possible.\nWe're looking for bright, curious builders who want to help millions of people experience the thrill of live entertainment by improving and modernizing our enterprise ticketing product. The ticketing industry is messy, complex and makes attending live events more difficult than it is; we believe a thoughtful application of software can fix that.\nWhat you'll do\n\nInfluence all levels of the stack from infrastructure through application and all phases of the software lifecycle from planning through implementation and ongoing operations\nBuild out a modern, containerized software architecture using industry-leading software development practices\nSwap out the engine while the plane is flying: replace and update critical components of both software and hardware architecture in an uptime-critical setting\nEvaluate new technologies and improve our software stack to maintain our technological edge\n\nWho you are\n\n7+ years of experience designing, building, and operating complex distributed systems on Kubernetes or similar orchestrators.
