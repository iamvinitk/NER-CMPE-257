Through this initiative we hope to increase diversity within the tech industry. WiseWomenCode will take place on the 28th, 29th, 1st March in our Singapore office.\nAt Wise, we believe that in order to build a diverse, empathetic and inclusive product we have to have a diverse team working on it. Unfortunately the current tech industry, although having made a lot of progress, is still not as diverse as it needs to be. So in an effort to help encourage women who are just getting started to enter the industry, we’ve decided to open our doors to show the inner workings of Wise. \nWe’re welcoming women and non-binary people to our office in Singapore, for three days of knowledge sharing, side by side coding sessions, networking and more, to provide a glimpse to the FinTech working world. You’ll be welcomed by representative's and leaders from the tech industry at Wise.\nWe encourage applications from students currently studying Computer Science (or related field) or if you have recently completed a coding Bootcamp and are looking to start a career in tech. \n* Daily allowance for travelling, lunch and refreshments will be provided to the participants everyday.We're people without borders — without judgement or prejudice, too. We believe teams are strongest when they are diverse, equitable and inclusive. We're proud to have a truly international team, and we celebrate our differences.\nEvery Wiser should feel that they can be themselves at work. Inclusive teams help us live our values and make sure every Wiser feels respected, empowered to share their contributions towards mission zero and able to progress in their careers.\nHaving diverse teams that reflect our diverse customer base helps us build a better product. We can be more creative and empathetic to our customer's needs and life experiences and makes sure we leave no-one behind on our journey to mission-zero.\nIf you want to find out more about what it's like to work at Wise visit Wise.Jobs.\nKeep up to date with life at Wise by following us on LinkedIn and Instagram.","departments":[{"id":72593,"name":"Early Careers","child_ids":[90932,86043,82378,81832,81235,81013,75781,72776,72602,72601,72600,72599,72598,72597,72596,72595,72594],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":19363,"name":"Singapore","location":null,"child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
