To create the best transportation experience for all, we start in our own community by creating an open, inclusive, and diverse organization where all team members are recognized for what they bring. We believe that trip by trip, we’re changing the way our world works. We imagine a world where cities feel small again, where transportation and tech bring people together, instead of taking them apart. We see the future as community-driven.     \nWhile we have a strong ride-sharing service in the US and in a few Canadian cities, we know that transportation isn’t just about cars, it’s about enjoying the ride, no matter the method. That’s why Lyft leaned in to micro-mobility, first joining hands with Montreal-based 8D Technologies in 2018 (from Motivate) and later with Longueuil-based PBSC in 2022, taking the place of the worldwide leader in bike-sharing. We want to provide solutions that people love and cities need. \nResponsibilities:\n\nUse the core Site Reliability Engineering principles of change management, monitoring, emergency response, capacity planning, and production readiness reviews to run the platform.\nBuild infrastructure and drive projects that break things with the aim to improve the robustness of production systems\nHelp define infrastructure roadmap and architecture based on technology and business needs.\nBuild holistic visibility into SLIs, SLOs, SLAs, dependency graphs, past performance of software, network, and system to ensure that we can continue to scale without increasing operational burden or toil.\nShare knowledge by giving brown bags, tech talks, and evangelizing appropriate tech and engineering best practices.\nStep back to observe patterns and develop innovative tools and automation to minimize toil. Use those learnings to drive the best operational practices.\nPartner with the broader Lyft organization to build a culture of rigorously learning from incidents.\nShare on-call responsibilities with other teammates and own the improvement of the team’s on-call practices\nUnblock, support, and effectively communicate across teams to achieve results\nAssist in cost engineering efforts to ensure efficient use of cloud resources.\n\nExperience:\n\nExperience designing, implementing and operating large-scale customer-facing SaaS infrastructure\nExperience with high level programming languages (Python, Go, Java, etc.) and declarative languages (eg.
