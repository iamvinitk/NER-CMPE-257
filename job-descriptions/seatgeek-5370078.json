With our technological savvy and fan-first attitude we’re simplifying and modernizing the ticketing industry. \nLive event tickets are an attractive medium for fraud. Among other things, tickets are a potentially high-dollar form of digital stored value, fulfillment is often instantaneous, transaction costs are relatively low, and the resale marketplace is very liquid. As a senior member of the Marketplace Operations team, the Senior Director of Risk Operations will be responsible for protecting SeatGeek against all forms of abuse, while also striking a revenue-maximizing balance with overall marketplace throughput.\nWhat you’ll do\n\nPeople management. You’ll directly manage (and grow, as needed) a combination of Managers, Senior Managers, high-level ICs, and their corresponding direct reports – a team currently consisting of about two dozen people. You will ensure high performance, retention, and employee engagement\nP&L responsibility. You’ll be accountable for reporting and maximizing the net revenue impact of fraud at SeatGeek: the savings from blocked/avoided fraud, the cost of insulted orders, and the costs of fraud refunds and chargebacks. As well as the staffing costs and operating expenses of the team itself\nRisk scoring technology. You’ll be the primary business stakeholder for SeatGeek’s first- and third-party risk-scoring, rules, and fraud analytics systems. As necessary you will lead related vendor selection decisions and existing vendor relations – all in service of having an increasingly high-precision, high-scale, software-driven approach to fraud detection and prevention\nInternal partnerships. You’ll form and maintain close and healthy working relationships with the R&D, Finance, and Support teams\nChargeback representment. You’ll design and run a team, processes, and software systems that achieve high win rates for disputes that we should win, and cost us relatively little wasted effort on disputes that we shouldn’t or can’t win\nGeneral fraud prevention. Your team will stay on top of the latest trends in credit card fraud, promo code abuse, seller fraud, account takeovers, and any other types of abuse that pose a threat to SeatGeek, and will implement protections to minimize such threats\nOrder review. Your team will design and execute Risk Agent order review processes that are fast, accurate, and sufficiently comprehensive to minimize missed fraud and supplier rejects within the capacity and cost constraints of the team\n\nWhat you have\n\n7-10 years of career experience, likely concentrated and most recently in a fraud / risk / trust & safety team or department\nAt least several years of experience specifically leading teams of similar size as SeatGeek, and preferentially at digital (or “anything”) marketplaces or high-pedigree consumer businesses with similar types of fraud exposure\nExpert-level familiarity with the software landscape in this space, including vendors like Sift Science\nExcellent data comprehension, numeracy, presentation/visualization, and storytelling skills\nVery high technical literacy – able to converse fluently in fraud-adjacent topics like bot detection; network architecture; payment gateways; relational databases, data modeling, and ETL processes, etc\nExperience with business intelligence/reporting applications like Looker, Tableau, etc\n\nPerks\n\nEquity stake\nFlexible work environment, allowing you to work as many days a week in the office as you’d like or 100% remotely\nA WFH stipend to support your home office setup\nFlexible PTO\nUp to 16 weeks of paid family leave\n401(k) matching program\nHealth, vision, dental, and life insurance\nAnnual subscriptions to Headspace, Ginger.io, and One Medical \n$120 a month to spend on tickets to live events\nAnnual subscription to Spotify, Apple Music, or Amazon music\n\n \n\nThe salary range for this role is $180,000-$250,000.
