How we will use information about you</strong><br />We will use the personal data we collect about you to:<br />&bull; assess your skills, qualifications, and suitability for the role;<br />&bull; carry out background and reference checks, where applicable;<br />&bull; communicate with you about the recruitment process;<br />&bull; keep records related to our hiring processes; and<br />&bull; comply with legal or regulatory requirements.<br />It is in our legitimate interests to decide whether to appoint you since it would be beneficial to our business to appoint a suitable candidate to that role. We also need to process your personal data to decide whether to enter into a contract of employment or engagement with you.<br />Having received your CV and covering letter and/or your application form, we will then process that information to decide whether you meet the basic requirements to be shortlisted for the role. If you do, we will decide whether your application is strong enough to invite you for an interview.
