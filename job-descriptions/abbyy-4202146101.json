Task Mining is an approach to process optimization, where we record how human individuals work and based on the recordings, we try to devise an optimal way of executing specific tasks (e.g. approving a loan request). A recording contains screenshots taken while the human executed the task, and our job is to extract various information from the screenshots. We should identify which form/screen the user was working on, which control they changed, and how it was changed. To successfully extract the information, we use OCR, object detection, clustering and similar techniques.
