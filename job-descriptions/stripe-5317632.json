Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nThe Cards Integrations Americas team builds and owns the code that integrates Stripe’s platform with the major North American credit and debit networks.\nTechnical Operations roles in Cards Integrations are a dynamic and key component of Stripe's success. Focused on financial partner integrations, we sit at the intersection of product/platform engineers and financial partners, connecting them and scaling their operational obligations.\nOur team partners closely with engineering teams to ensure accurate charge presentation during authorization and settlement/clearance. We are experts in network technical specifications, and bear primary responsibility for interpreting and planning updates to Stripe-to-card-network communication protocols.\nWhat you’ll do\nResponsibilities\n\nBecome a domain expert in an area of Stripe’s payments stack  \nHandle inquiries from internal Stripes and external partners' technical teams, often requiring detailed investigation and code or configuration changes\nEngage with Stripe's financial partners to drive alignment on product usage, troubleshoot and solve technical problems, compliance concerns, or functional breakages\nOrganize and direct complex technical changes and projects between Stripe and our partners\nIdentify and automate inefficient or unnecessary manual processes through code changes, partner agreements, or making and coordinating more complex code changes across Stripe\nDesign future anomaly detection systems and tools to ensure that data flowing through our partner and internal systems is reliable and correct\nCollaborate across the company, including engineering, accounting, financial partnerships and product, to trace and account for billions of dollars moving through the Stripe platform\n\nWho you are\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role. If you meet these requirements, you are encouraged to apply. The preferred qualifications are a bonus, not a requirement.\nTechnical Operations roles are one part coding and one part managing projects. The ideal candidate will have experience in both, but successful candidates may index more highly in one or the other. We work mostly in Ruby and Java. However, languages can be learned: we care much more about your general coding skill than knowledge of a particular language or framework.\nMinimum requirements\n\nAbility to interpret, review, and contribute changes to high quality code. \nFluency using SQL-like query languages to navigate Stripe's data and diagnose the scope and urgency of issues\nComfort with developer tools (e.g. git), and an ability to make well-scoped code changes in Stripe's codebase\nGreat technical problem-solving skills, with an ability to develop a working understanding of a technical system using a variety of methods. These include: reading documentation and partner specifications, interpreting logs, writing and executing queries to understand the behavior of production systems, and asking well-formed questions to domain experts.\nGreat communication skills, with an ability to frame messages appropriately for technical and non-technical audiences\nThe will to deliver results, with an ability to establish priorities and reliably execute on solutions (often with hard external deadlines)\nAn instinct to produce work that increases the impact of others, and helps us scale and grow (e.g. documentation, tools)\n\nPreferred qualifications\n\nKnowledge of and experience with payment technologies and ecosystems\n","departments":[{"id":61598,"name":"8548 Payins Online - Eng","child_ids":[],"parent_id":78842}],"offices":[{"id":65234,"name":"US","location":null,"child_ids":[89624,89623,85342,80440,83845,83838,83816,83833,83832,83828,83827,83826,83823,83818,83814,83862,83861,83860,83859,83858,83857,83856,83855,83854,83853,83852,83851,83850,83849,83848,83847,83846,83844,83843,83842,83841,83840,83839,83837,83836,83835,83834,83831,83830,83829,83825,83824,83822,83821,83820,83819,83817,83815,83813,83812,83811,83810,83809,83808,83807,83806,83805,83804,83803,83802,83801,83800,83799,83798,83797,83796,83795,83794,83793,83792,83791,83790,83789,83788,83787,83786,83785,83784,83783,83782,83781,83780,83779,83778,83777,83776,83775,83774,83773,83772,83771,83770,83769,83768,83767,61414,65238,61413,16654],"parent_id":673}],"compliance":[{"type":"eeoc","questions":[],"description":"&lt;p&gt;PUBLIC BURDEN STATEMENT: According to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 no persons are required to respond to a collection of information unless such collection displays a valid OMB control number.
