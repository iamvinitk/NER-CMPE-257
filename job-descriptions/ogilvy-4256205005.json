We continue that rich legacy through Borderless Creativity—operating, innovating, and creating at the intersection of talent and capabilities. Our experts in Public Relations, Consulting, Advertising, Health, and Experience work together to inspire brands and people to impact the world.\nStrategy at Ogilvy\nOgilvy is the home of Borderless Creativity. \nThe strategy team is the start point for making that intention a reality. We’re a diverse bunch of thinkers – Brand Strategists, Data Analysts, Experience Design, Insight, Social Content, CRM and PR and much more. We come from all sorts of backgrounds to solve all sorts of problems.\nThis role sits within the wider strategy community (or nearly 100 people!). We share our knowledge and we foster a culture of curiosity and mutual support. You will be a very welcome member of this awesome crew.\nOne Unilever is our borderless model created to continue the incredible legacy of Ogilvy X Unilever. The Dove CSO is based in New York and the majority of the team is based in the UK – meaning we can be close to where the clients are and experience the best of global collaboration.\nThe Dove opportunity\nDove is one of Unilever’s flagship brands and one of Ogilvy’s flagship accounts. Dove started its life\nin 1957 in the US, with the revolutionary new ‘beauty bar’. It’s always been a brand built on superior care and difference (the beauty bar technically isn’t a soap, it uses a different formula to standard soaps with built-in moisturisers). Since its launch it has grown to become one of the world’s leading beauty and personal care brands, encompassing body care, haircare and deodorants, plus the dedicated Dove Men+ Care and Baby Dove ranges, with Dove now sold in more than 150 countries around the world.\nDove is a brand with an unparalled communications history. The Ogilvy-Dove partnership dates back to the late 1950s, with David Ogilvy coining the famous ‘1/4 moisturising cream’ line that is still used today. Dove has always communicated differently, with its ads throughout the 1960s and 1970s departing from the standard beauty ads of the day to speak through the powerful testimonials and\nrecommendations of ‘real women’.\nOgilvy developed the iconic ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’ for Dove in 2004, with the mission to make beauty a source of confidence, not anxiety for all women. The ‘Campaign for Real Beauty’ includes many iconic adverts such as ‘Tick Box’, ‘Evolution’ and ‘Sketches’ (which has now been viewed more than 10m times on YouTube alone). As a recognition of Dove’s rich communications history, in 2019 Dove was named as one of Effie’s top 5 brands of the last 50 years, alongside Apple IBM, Mastercard and Nike.\nBut the Dove story doesn’t end here. As more and more brands seek to put purpose at their heart, the challenge is for Dove to maintain its lead as the world’s most meaningful beauty brand. We’re rising to that opportunity at Ogilvy by developing a new brand platform and by creating ever more exciting, challenging and provocative creative campaigns, finding new ways to interact with women all over the world about the issues that really matter to them, and driving real and lasting social change.\nThe role and what we need you to bring\nThe Masterbrand role for Dove is all about creativity. Historically (as in every year including 2022), our campaigns for Masterbrand have dominated the creative award shows – and we will be the generation of team on it which doubles down on that legacy.\nAs a strategy director we know you will be buttoned down on the fundamentals – you will know the value of insight, how to build a brand, how to work well with clients. You will also want to make work which works. But more than anything you will know what gives the creatives goosebumps. You will be able to package your thinking irresistibly. We don’t mind where you come from – maybe you haven’t even worked in an agency before – you definitely won’t have followed a predictable path – but we care very much about where you want to go. We’re excited to meet you if you think we are doing it all wrong, or missing the point, or we’re falling short. Challenge and conviction and restless impatience to make your mark are 100% what we want to see.\nWhilst everyone across our fab strategy community looks out for juniors, helps them learn and builds their confidence, this is not a team management role. You’ll be more at home one-to-one with a creative or our CSO, kicking about ideas, than you will be building a team.\nOur promise to you\nAt Ogilvy UK, we want to make sure that you’re set up to grow and develop in your role and enjoy some of the best times of your working career. Our learning and development team are on hand to provide training for you, to help you excel in every aspect of your role. So, if you think you may not have experience in some aspects of this position, don’t worry, and apply away. We’re here to help you grow and nurture your skills.\nHow we help you Thrive:\n\n25 days annual leave + 1 Volunteer Day\nBupa Healthcare (now includes Bupa health assessment and menopause support)\nEnhanced Maternity, Adoption and Shared Parental leave\nWe have a flexible working policy with core working hours (10am – 4pm) and have launched our 3.2 Hybrid Working model\nA 1.5:1 matching pension structure\nWellbeing and Health: Up to £25.00 per month towards physical or online exercise class membership plus Dental cover, Unmind membership, LifeWorks tool and annual eye tests.\nLearning and development budgets plus Enhanced and ongoing wellbeing incentives and activities throughout the year\nSeason ticket loan and cycle to work scheme\nLife Assurance x4 salary\nInclusion@Ogilvy: To foster an inclusive environment we have our internal groups: Ogilvy Rewired, Roots, Equals, Proud plus Parents and Carers. See here for more information\n\n\n\nAt Ogilvy, our people are at the heart of what we do: a creative agency that sparks game-changing ideas across culture and business through collaboration, integrity, and a celebration of self-expression. \nWe believe in building powerful teams with purpose. This means hiring and nurturing talent across all races, ethnicities, religions, abilities, sexual orientation, and gender identities – and we relentlessly curate transformative initiatives that make our commitment to fairness, and equity a reality. \nOur ultimate mission is to leave a positive impact on the world, creating a better future for all, while supporting and uplifting the global communities we serve.  This is central to our mantra of Borderless Creativity.\nAll qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran.\n ","departments":[{"id":4029927005,"name":"Strategy & Planning","child_ids":[],"parent_id":null}],"offices":[{"id":4011523005,"name":"Ogilvy London","location":"London, England, United Kingdom","child_ids":[],"parent_id":4011656005}],"compliance":null,"demographic_questions":{"header":"Voluntary Equal Opportunities Questions (UK)","description":"<p class=\"x_MsoNormal\">At&nbsp;Ogilvy we pride ourselves on being an inclusive and equal opportunities employer.
