As a member of the Legal team, you will become a trusted expert and business partner on issues that impact virtually every part of the company. You will lead the development, execution, and continuous improvement of Skydio’s compliance programs. You will routinely interface with executives, engineers, sales leaders and partners. The ideal candidate will be a seasoned compliance professional with strong judgment and attention to detail, with 5+ years of experience in compliance.\nHow you will make an impact\n\nPartner with key stakeholders across the business to refine and implement the company’s compliance policies and procedures while promoting a culture of compliance. \nCollaborate with business functions to understand their priorities and build integrated, forward-looking trade compliance processes.\nReview cutting-edge, AI-enabled drone and software products for export classification and compliance with other U.S. and international legal regimes.\nCreate and maintain internal governing documents, including exports controls, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and others.\nSupervise the preparation and filing of export licensing documents.\nDrive compliance training programs and ongoing communications that help to fuel Skydio’s culture of compliance.\nMonitor compliance practices on an ongoing basis.\nManage Skydio’s external assurance reviews and audits.\nInvestigate and implement tools designed to streamline compliance functions.\n\nWhat Makes You a Good Fit\n\nYou excel at analyzing and communicating complex information in a clear, compelling way.\nYou are passionate about the opportunity to play a key role in the rebirth of the domestic drone industry, powered by Skydio’s AI-driven technology.

You know how to build systems and processes built to last. \nYou do not think any issues are too big--or too small--to handle. You seize opportunities to support your teammates (who will do the same for you).\nYou have at least five years of compliance experience, particularly in export controls (EAR and ITAR), FCPA, and federal government contracting.\nYou seize the initiative, identifying issues before they become problems.
