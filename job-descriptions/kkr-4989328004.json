Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is a leading global investment firm that offers alternative asset management and capital markets and insurance solutions. KKR aims to generate attractive investment returns by following a patient and disciplined investment approach, employing world-class people, and supporting growth in its portfolio companies and communities. KKR sponsors investment funds that invest in private equity, credit and real assets and has strategic partners that manage hedge funds. KKR’s insurance subsidiaries offer retirement, life and reinsurance products under the management of The Global Atlantic Financial Group. KKR 2024 MBA Internship Program - KKR Capstone\nNew York and Menlo Park\nKKR Capstone is seeking current 1st-year MBA students (graduation date: Spring 2025) for our 2024 MBA Internship Program and to be an active part of a team-oriented environment. The internship is 10-weeks in length and will take place in our New York and Menlo Park offices. Following the conclusion of the internship, 2025 full-time offers as Associates may be extended to exceptional performers.\nKKR Capstone\nKKR Capstone is KKR’s operations group and a unique “CEO University” for MBA graduates. KKR Capstone’s mission is to deliver exceptional returns on KKR’s investments by partnering with management teams to drive value in KKR portfolio companies, as well as integrating within deal teams to select the right assets. At portfolio companies, KKR Capstone drives the most important operational issues on the CEO and Board of Directors’ agendas, including top-line growth, cost optimization, organizational structure and capability, capital investment, and strategic M&A initiatives. During due diligence, KKR Capstone joins deal teams in evaluating potential acquisitions, including weighing in on crucial operational issues and value creation levers, assessing the target company’s market, and understanding the strength of the company’s position in the industry.\nOn a day-to-day basis, KKR Capstone executives interact with a broad range of company personnel including the Board, C-suite and line-level operators. The majority of KKR Capstone team members have previous experience in management consulting. While the executives heavily leverage the skills and experience gained in consulting, they spend the bulk of their time identifying, rapidly prototyping, and executing operational improvement initiatives (i.e. less time spent on PowerPoint and more time dealing with general management challenges).\nKKR Capstone provides a unique opportunity for high-performing candidates to drive real operating change and value generation in a private equity environment, gaining valuable experience as general managers. KKR Capstone executives are expected to take ownership of key priorities and initiatives at the portfolio company, are held accountable for individual results, and are typically the primary agents of change within the organization. Team members can rise within KKR Capstone, transition into opportunities within the broader KKR firm, or take senior operating roles inside or outside the KKR portfolio. Due to the hands-on operating experience KKR Capstone executives gain, ~70% of alums who have left the team in the past decade are now C-suite execs, and more than 1/3 are CEOs.\nIn appreciation of the sponsorship that many former consultants have to return to their prior firm, KKR provides competitive tuition reimbursement for qualifying Interns that receive full-time offers to return as Associates in 2025. \nPrimary Qualifications and Skills\n\nCurrent 1st year MBA student with anticipated graduation date of Spring 2025\nCandidates must embody KKR’s core values, in particular: unquestioned integrity, a strong work ethic, and a commitment to teamwork and excellence.\nIdeal candidates have a genuine enthusiasm and curiosity for Private Equity & Alternative Assets investing, a strong understanding of fundamental business analysis, and an outstanding professional and academic performance record (e.g., top tier performance ratings, early promotions, top class rankings).\nPrior consulting experience is preferred\n\nTo learn more about KKR Capstone from our team, alumni, and portfolio leaders, please see the video here.\nApplication Instructions:\n\nDeadline to apply is December 3rd -- 11:59pm ET\nA candidate may apply to a maximum of 2 teams for KKR’s MBA Summer Internship Program\n\n \n#LI-DNIThis is the expected annual base salary range for this Menlo Park-based position.
