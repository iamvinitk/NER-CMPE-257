We hire the best of the best to ensure you’re working with people you can constantly learn from. You’re trusted to get your work done your way while testing the limits of what’s possible and what’s next. We work hard to provide a culture where everyone feels supported, and our employees feel it—their votes helped us become one of Newsweek's Top 100 Global Most Loved Workplaces in 2023.\nWe also value sports. Not just because of the big wins and highlight-worthy plays, but because of the lasting impact sports can have: the lifelong lessons in teamwork and dedication; the influence of inspiring mentors; the priceless opportunities to play at the next level. Sports can change lives—that’s what we value.\nOur team helps the world see sports differently through products that make it easier to capture video, analyze data, share highlights and do a lot more.  \nReady to join us?\nYour Role\nWe’re looking for someone to join our global Workplace team in Lincoln, which focuses on providing Hudl employees safe, secure, well-maintained and efficient offices. You’ll be collaborating internally across departments, externally with different contractors and vendors, and across time zones to ensure that we’re tracking and solving problems, plus getting ahead of future issues. You’ll take on managing a growing lease portfolio, ensuring you understand each property and the associated building systems, construction and appropriate contacts. You’ll bring clarity and organization to a complex realm and be able to clearly communicate all facets of our associated budgets, insurance, leases, office safety and security.This role requires 3-4 days in the office per week, so we're currently considering candidates who live within a commuting distance of our office in Lincoln.\nMust-Haves\n\nExperienced. You’ve spent 3+ years in the facilities management world, and have hands-on knowledge of: building operations, real estate lease management, risk assessment and prevention, operations expenses (OpEx), capital expenditures (CapEx), budgeting, and forecasting. \nOrganized. You understand and crave organization. There are many facets to the workplace and you want to understand and add order to all of them.A problem solver. You aren’t satisfied until the problem is resolved, whether it’s identifying the cause of a leak across a multi-story property or tracking down the missing numbers in a multi-year OpEx budget.\nAutonomous. You’re part of a larger team, but a lot of your work is unique and specific—you’re able to prioritize projects and work without daily guidance.\nAdaptive. Things at Hudl can change rapidly, which means your priorities may shift quickly. You understand and even appreciate that every day will be different.\nDetail-oriented. Whether it’s ensuring your spreadsheet is tidy and accurate, or verifying that AHU filters were installed correctly, you understand that the details are critical.\n\nNice-to-Haves\n\nCollaborative. You’re able to work across departments to pool your talents and develop solutions to important problems.\nClear communication. You work through big complex problems with clear communication, talking through the issues and solutions, oftentimes to people that will be unfamiliar with the terminology or processes.\nResourceful. Clearly identifying the problem and figuring out who or what your best resources will be to solve it comes naturally to you.\n\nOur Role\n\nChampion work-life harmony. We’ll give you the flexibility you need in your work life (e.g., flexible vacation time, company-wide holidays and timeout (meeting-free) days, remote work options and more) so you can enjoy your personal life too.\nGuarantee autonomy. We have an open, honest culture and we trust our people from day one. Your team will support you, but you’ll own your work and have the agency to try new ideas. \nEncourage career growth. We’re lifelong learners who encourage professional development. We’ll give you tons of resources and opportunities to keep growing.\nProvide an environment to help you succeed. We've invested in our offices, designing incredible spaces with our employees in mind. But whether you’re at the office or working remotely, we’ll provide you the tech stack and hardware to do your best work.\nSupport your mental and physical health. We care about our employees’ wellbeing. Our Employee Assistance Program, employee resource groups and fitness partner Peerfit have you covered.\nCover your medical insurance. We have multiple plans to pick from to ensure you’ll have the coverage you (and your dependents) want, including vision, dental, fertility healthcare and family forming benefits.\nContribute to your 401(K). Yep, that’s free money. We’ll match up to 4% of your own contribution.\nInclusion at Hudl\nHudl is an equal opportunity employer. Through our actions, behaviors and attitude, we’ll create an environment where everyone, no matter their differences, feels like they belong. We offer resources to ensure our employees feel safe bringing their authentic selves to work, including employee resource groups and communities. But we recognize there’s ongoing work to be done, which is why we track our efforts and commitments in annual inclusion reports. We also know imposter syndrome is real and the confidence gap can get in the way of meeting spectacular candidates.
