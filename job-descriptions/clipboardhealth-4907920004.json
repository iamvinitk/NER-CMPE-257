We dramatically improve lives, by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want, and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.\nAbout Clipboard Health:\nClipboard Health is a post-Series C, extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects, revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote team. We have been named one of YC’s Top Companies for two years running, and have grown 25x across all key metrics in the last 18 months. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities, who can then better serve patients. To learn more about the culture at Clipboard Health, take a look at our culture hub here.About the Role:\nThe Associate Product Manager – New Grad position is designed to grow undergraduates into product leaders. APMs at Clipboard Health move quickly, with high ownership and good judgment from day 1. Previous APMs have scaled operational processes, written new pricing algorithms from scratch, and built new products all on their own. On their own = they were given a problem → they wrote an excellent plan that solved the problem → they executed that plan with full ownership. \nOur APMs are generalists who work closely with our executive team. Instead of coming in with a toolkit and looking for problems it can solve (which often leads to incremental problem solving), they focus on the biggest problems and quickly devise new ways to solve them from first principles. Doing this from day 1 requires that our APMs are boundlessly curious and jump right into understanding our business, our users, and our product. We think that their curiosity and the ability to dive deep ultimately equips them to be excellent contributors and effective leaders.\nOwnership is not given to APMs once we think they are able to lead projects. APMs are expected to lead important projects from the get-go. Their plans and the quality of their execution are met with the same level of scrutiny as that of a Group Product Manager’s. We think that doing the work and getting feedback on it is one of the fastest (perhaps the fastest) ways to learn and grow, but it’s not the best path for everyone. We encourage you to think deeply about if that’s something you want.\nI’d read the following docs from our team prior to applying: the Product Team Standards, Product Team Recruiting, and Product Team Structure. These documents will give you a sense of how we think and what we value. We also have more links about team and company culture on our candidate website.\nIn your first 30 days you’ll:\n\nTalk to customers, understand their problems, and surface issues we weren’t devoting enough attention to\nRamp up on the business, the product, and how we work\nDesign and run marketplace experiments to validate hypotheses\nWrite weekly write-ups and other documentation to keep others abreast of your work\n\nIn your first 90 days you’ll:\n\nOwn an important problem on your own\nWrite a plan (you may have to write several drafts) that proposes a solution to the problem\nBroadcast the plan to relevant stakeholders, get their feedback, and adjust it\nExecute on the plan and report findings to the executive team\n\nYou can’t be successful here if you:\n\nDon’t enjoy writing. We write a lot, and we hold our writing to a high standard. If you aren’t comfortable being scrutinized on not only the content but the clarity of your writing week over week, our culture won’t be a good fit for you.\nWant to know what to do. In your role as an APM, you’ll regularly be given tasks that are seemingly ambiguous. You will have to use your judgment to bring clarity to it. You may even propose that the task isn’t something we should focus on today. That’s okay too.\nDon’t like working with data or math. As a marketplace company, we have a highly quantitative culture. Our language is steeped in numbers.\nDon’t enjoy talking to customers. We talk to our customers day in and day out. Our customer conversations are an integral part of how we make decisions.\nDon’t want an intellectual challenge. The problems we face are novel and challenging, and we expect people to solve them quickly. If you aren’t looking for an intellectual challenge in your role, this won’t be a good fit.\n\nBenefits:\n\nCompetitive compensation\nUnlimited vacation\n100% remote with tri-annual offsites\n\n\n\n#LI-DNI\n\n\n","departments":[{"id":4037304004,"name":"Strategy & Operations","child_ids":[],"parent_id":4013034004}],"offices":[],"compliance":null,"demographic_questions":null,"questions":[{"description":null,"label":"First Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"first_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Last Name","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"last_name","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Email","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"email","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Phone","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"phone","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Resume/CV","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"resume","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"resume_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Cover Letter","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"cover_letter","type":"input_file","values":[]},{"name":"cover_letter_text","type":"textarea","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"LinkedIn Profile","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"question_9049668004","type":"input_text","values":[]}]},{"description":null,"label":"Website","required":false,"fields":[{"name":"question_9049669004","type":"input_text","values":[]}]}],"location_questions":[]}
