We guide our audience from discovery to obsession. We inspire essential conversations about what’s now, what’s next, and what’s possible.\nAs a community of journalists and storytellers, business professionals, creators and technologists, we believe it is a moral and business imperative to amplify voices: to cultivate diversity, equity, and inclusion throughout our organization and media. This applies to our candidates, our teams, our storytelling, our creative work, and our platforms, products, and partnerships.\nThe Verge's policy team is dedicated to illuminating how politics, law, and regulation affect the technologies that shape readers' lives — and how technology is shaping all those fields as well. As a US presidential election approaches, the Supreme Court prepares to take on online speech challenges, and EU regulation changes the basic operating principles of services like iMessage, we're delving into the goals of politicians, regulators, and activists; weighing the intended and unintended consequences of their efforts; and looking for the nuance behind the biggest issues of the day. \n \nWHAT YOU’LL DO\nThe Verge is looking for a senior reporter to cover the policy and politics of technology, including the 2024 US elections and beyond. You’ll spend your days finding big stories and breaking down enormously complex topics around technology lawmaking and more. \nSenior reporters at The Verge are responsible for working with editors to identify and maintain a beat, then proactively generating stories on that beat. As tech policy reporter, your duties will be a mix of reporting on the news of the day and digging into longer-lead investigations that will drive news cycles of their own. \nYour responsibilities will include:\n\nDeveloping your beat with coverage from news to larger reports and analysis.\nWorking across our teams to find and explain stories around tech policy.\nDevelop and nourish sources in the communities being affected by tech policy and with the companies and activists working for better tech policy.\nProactively pitch news and analysis, and help vet stories.\nHelp us maintain our collaborative and ambitious team culture.\n\n \nWHO YOU ARE\nYou care deeply about politics and policy because of what they mean for people. You have a vision for strong, focused election coverage that doesn’t just report what candidates are telling voters, but presses them for the answers that matter — on topics ranging from online speech to the future of the FCC to the right to repair. You’ve published scoops and built a network of contacts and sources in the tech policy area.\nQualifications:\n\nExtensive experience reporting in the tech policy space.\nExperience covering a US election.\nStrong knowledge of tech policy and lawmaking.\nA roster of good contacts in politics and major tech companies.\nStrong writing skills, including the ability to identify compelling angles and develop them effectively.\n\nIf you think you have what it takes, but don't meet every single point in our job posting, please apply with a cover letter to let us know how you believe you can bring your unique skills to the Vox Media team or get in touch! We’ve hired chefs who became editors, DJs who became UX designers, and sommeliers who became writers.\n \nWHERE YOU’LL WORK\nThis job is remote or hybrid. This job is able to be based in our New York office.\n \nWHY VOX MEDIA?\nWHAT WE OFFER\nThis is a permanent, full-time position. This job is benefits-eligible. We pride ourselves in providing comprehensive benefits to support all of our employees wherever they are in life.
