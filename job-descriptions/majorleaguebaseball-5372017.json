Collectively, they compose a population as diverse as any other group of athletes in professional sport.\nSuccess on the field is not measured by one individual’s talent, but rather how a team of individuals with different skills comes together to achieve a common goal. Each and every day, teams seek the best talent in order to stay ahead of the curve in the ultra-competitive landscape of the Major Leagues.\nMajor League Baseball understands that we must apply that same approach to our front offices in order to secure the game's next generation of leadership. With that in mind, Major League Baseball is pleased to announce the 2024 Diversity Fellowship Program. \nWHAT IS THE MLB DIVERSITY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM?\nThis is the fourth cohort of Baseball's efforts to competitively recruit the most talented individuals and brightest young minds entering the workforce will provide the opportunity for young, diverse professionals to experience front office positions that have been traditionally influential in baseball operations decisions. Fellows will have the opportunity to work in baseball operations and see the inner workings of a front office. Areas of baseball operations include major league operations, player development, scouting, research and development, performance science, and beyond.  Since the inception of the program in 2018, over 90% of the candidates selected have been hired into full-time roles within the industry (through the first two completed cohorts).\nThe MLB Diversity Fellowship Program will allow us to stay true to the ideals of equal opportunity while solidifying Major League Baseball as an organization of choice for all recent graduates.\nThis distinct opportunity will place candidates in entry-level roles within one of the MLB Clubs and MLB’s Central Office. The Club-based program will be an 18-month commitment in a front office or baseball operations role at one of the MLB Clubs around the country participating in the MLB Diversity Fellowship Program.\nMLB Club Diversity Fellowship Program\nThank you for your interest in the MLB Club Diversity Fellowship Program, a rewarding opportunity to start a career in baseball operations and be a part of building a world class sports franchise. Eligible candidates will be placed in one of our 30 Clubs in the United States or Canada and appointed to an entry-level role in either the front office or baseball operations department for a minimum of 18 months. The Fellows will not have the option to choose a Club or location until offers are formally made, so applicants should have flexibility to relocate for any of the assignments. While all disciplines are eligible to apply, we strongly encourage candidates with degrees or knowledge in economics, statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, law, and business to submit applications. The Fellowship will begin post-graduation (if applicable) on a mutually agreed upon date between the Club and the chosen fellow.\nMLB Office of the Commissioner Diversity Fellowship Program\nThank you for your interest in the MLB Office of the Commissioner Diversity Fellowship Program. MLB's Diversity Fellowship Program is a rewarding opportunity to start a career in baseball and be a part of growing a world class, global sports business.

During his or her tenure, each fellow will rotate through MLB's baseball operations department under the supervision of respective department heads. While all disciplines are eligible to apply, we strongly encourage candidates with degrees or knowledge in economics, statistics, computer science, applied mathematics, law, and business to submit applications. The Fellowship will begin post-graduation (if applicable) on a mutually agreed upon date between the Office of the Commissioner and the chosen fellow.\nEligibility\n\nCandidates must be recent graduates (2019 graduates to upcoming Spring 2024 graduates) with either a Bachelor's degree, Master's Degree or related advanced degree, including completion of technical software engineering coursework.\nRecommended GPA of 3.0 or higher\nA passion for and knowledge of baseball is helpful but not required\nFormer professional baseball and softball players (including national team members) who have earned a degree(s) and do not meet the graduation date requirement will also be eligible.\nFor the Club Fellowship Program, a commitment of at least 18 months of employment is required at any participating Club in which you are placed.\nExact locations are up to the discretion of Major League Baseball and participating Clubs.\n\nApplication documentation:\n\nResume\nA personal statement (500 words or less)\nLetters of recommendation (optional)\nCover Letter\n\nThe MLB Diversity Fellowship application deadline is Friday, October 27, 2023.  Candidates are encouraged to apply as soon as possible, as applications will be reviewed and passed along to participating teams on a regular basis prior to the application deadline.
