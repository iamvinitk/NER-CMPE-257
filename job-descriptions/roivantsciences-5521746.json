We’ve employed a unique, decentralized model of nimble, focused companies (‘Vants’) focused on various therapeutic areas and built around the pursuit of innovation in drug development and technology.\nOur model is different. Five new medicines have been approved off the Roivant platform; we’ve built five biotechs that have become public; we’ve created well over $1b in value in Roivant Health in just four and a half years.  Our successes have ranged from computational drug discovery to tokenized healthcare data exchange, and from novel topicals for dermatological conditions to ultrarare tissue therapies.\nRoivant Health is Roivant’s platform for the creation of new technology Vants, focused on delivering improvements to human health outside of our traditional biotech platform.  In 4.5 years since inception, we’ve created three enduring companies and over $1B in enterprise value, including the leading deidentified healthcare data exchange platform (Datavant) and a top-tier computational drug discovery company (VantAI) which has partnered with SK Holdings, Johnson & Johnson, and Boehringer Ingelheim. Our goal is to improve human health by rapidly discovering, developing and delivering innovative medicines and technologies to all patients. Our success is predicated on attracting and retaining top talent, generating new ideas and promoting an open and collaborative culture.\nWe embrace diversity across all dimensions and levels of the organization and we strive to ensure every employee is supported in reaching their full potential.
