Now a part of the Daimler family, we are focused solely on developing software for automated trucks to transform how the world moves freight.\nJoin us and catapult your career with the company that helped pioneer autonomous technology, and the first AV software company with the vision to partner directly with a truck manufacturer.Meet the team:\nAccurate and highly available information about the vehicle ego-motion and localization is central to ensure an adequate functioning of the virtual driver software of an autonomous truck. Core functionalities such as environment perception and prediction, as well as motion planning and control, strongly rely on this information to guarantee that the vehicle executes a collision-free driving plan. Accordingly, our ego-motion and localization modules are responsible for supplying reliable ego-motion and localization state estimates even in the presence of external disturbances, sensor imperfections, and system degradation.\nAs part of the ego-motion estimation and localization team, you will be able to design, implement, and improve sensor fusion algorithms for the real-time estimation of the vehicle pose, velocity and acceleration. You will also gain a deep understanding of not only self-driving technology, but also its real-world challenges and how to convert such technology into real products.\nWhat you will do:  \nWe are seeking an intern to research and develop software that enables an accurate ego-motion and localization solution, even in the presence of faults in the information sources used.\nAs part of the ego-motion and localization team, you will be able to \n\nResearch the state-of-the-art fault detection and diagnosis and apply excellent algorithm design and programming skills to guarantee a reliable ego-motion and localization solution, even in the presence of faults and information inconsistencies.\nExecute full software development lifecycle activities using C++, including prototyping, and deploying robust and reliable solutions for the ego-motion and localization problems.\nTest developed algorithms in both simulation and on our trucks.\nCollaborate with a creative team of engineers and researchers to solve multi-disciplinary problems.\nImprove how our vehicles act and react in complex and nuanced situations.\n\nWhat you will need to Succeed:\n\nBachelor’s degree in computer science, robotics, electrical, mechanical, aerospace engineering, or related technical field.\nEnrolled student in a master's degree program in computer science, robotics, electrical, mechanical, aerospace engineering, or related technical field.\nGood academic performance.\nHands-on experience in C++ programming, as well as solid Python programming skills.\nExperience with Linux.\nAbility to implement algorithms efficiently and in a well-organized software architecture.\nKnowledge in probability, statistics, probabilistic modeling, and linear algebra.\nExcellent communication skills as well as fluency in English.\n\n \nBonus Points:\n\nKnowledge of safety engineering, functional safety and requirements engineering according to ISO26262.\nProficient with ROS (Robot Operating System).\nKnowledge of vehicle kinematics, dynamics, mechatronics, and E/E-Systems.\nKnowledge in unit testing.\n\n \n#LI-KK1Hiring Range for Job Opening US Pay Range$31—$37 USDAt Torc, we’re committed to building a diverse and inclusive workplace. We celebrate the uniqueness of our Torc’rs and do not discriminate based on race, religion, color, national origin, gender (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, veteran status, or disabilities.\nEven if you don’t meet 100% of the qualifications listed for this opportunity, we encourage you to apply.
