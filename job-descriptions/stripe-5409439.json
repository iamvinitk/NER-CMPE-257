Millions of companies—from the world’s largest enterprises to the most ambitious startups—use Stripe to accept payments, grow their revenue, and accelerate new business opportunities. Our mission is to increase the GDP of the internet, and we have a staggering amount of work ahead. That means you have an unprecedented opportunity to put the global economy within everyone’s reach while doing the most important work of your career.\nAbout the team\nWPP is organized into two pillars, each of which is grouped into pods that focus on the central tenets of Stripe's public mission. The Presence pillar creates industry-leading designs for Stripe’s front door surfaces, educates customers about the power of our platform, and drives our business success. The Platform pillar builds the internal machinery that powers these surfaces, and is responsible for making our websites fast, stable, and easy to modify.\nTogether we design and build stripe.com and other sites that amount to what is, for many, their first impression of Stripe. As such, WPP offers exciting opportunities to have a major impact on Stripe’s success. We want to make every pixel count, we want it to be enthralling, and we want to help other Stripes seamlessly benefit from our systematic work.\nWhat you’ll do\nIn your role as a Growth and Experimentation Designer on WPP, you will demonstrate the autonomy and initiative of a self-starter individual contributor. Your expertise in leading strategic design experimentation will be instrumental to our ongoing growth and success.\nYour main function will be user acquisition and monetization, achieved through a users-first approach to experimentation. You'll engage in an iterative process to enhance every aspect of the user journey—from awareness to retention. By conducting comprehensive research on our diverse target demographics, you'll understand their personas, needs, and obstacles preventing them from taking action. Furthermore, you'll strategize and implement design experiences that attract, inform, and successfully convert on stripe.com. You will work hand-in-hand with the Design Engineers on WPP, jointly crafting state-of-the-art variations that enhance our web presence. Your mission will span the breadth of our design systems, using them to optimize the website while also contributing your unique touch.\nYour collaborations will not merely be confined to within your team: product marketing and growth teams will be regular partners in your quest to devise the best information architecture and narratives to maximize user acquisition. Furthermore, you will be instrumental in making strategic decisions that impact the entirety of our web presence, driven by your findings from thorough experimentation and in-depth growth data analysis.\nMuch of your work will revolve around the management of diverse, simultaneous projects within a fast-paced setting. You'll strike a balance between creating delightful experiences for users that meet our quality bar and driving conversion. The ultimate objective: accelerate our growth, an ambition to be realized through your vital role.\nResponsibilities\n\nImplement and manage a growth process that drives key business metrics such as conversions, customer acquisition, and user engagement across our web presence.\nCollaborate with the Design Engineers to craft new variations\nUtilize and refine existing design systems, building upon them to optimize our website and drive growth.\nDevelop and execute A/B or multivariate tests, analyze results, and suggest improvements based on those results.\nPartner with product marketing teams and growth to strategize on how to best define information architecture and tell the right stories to increase user acquisition\nWork closely with cross-functional teams to understand our customers' needs, segment-based behaviors, and potential growth opportunities. Provide data-driven solutions based on those insights.\nHelp influence strategic decisions across all corners of our web presence based on experimentation insights and growth data.\nCreate, track, and report key performance indicators to leadership, providing insights on the levers of growth.\n\nWho you are\nWe’re looking for someone who meets the minimum requirements to be considered for the role.

In-office expectations for office-assigned Stripes vary by team. A remote location, in most cases, is defined as living 50 miles or more from an office location. While you would be welcome to join the office for team or business meetings when necessary, the expectation would be that you would regularly work from home rather than a Stripe office location. Stripe offices are located in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Bengaluru, Berlin, Chicago, Dubai, Dublin, Jakarta, London, Madrid, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, S&atilde;o Paulo, Singapore, South San Francisco, Seattle, Tokyo, and Toronto. Stripe does not cover the cost of relocating to a remote location. We encourage you to apply for roles that match the location in which you live or have intentions to live.</span></em></p>","label":"If this role offers the option to work from a remote location, do you plan to work remotely?","required":true,"fields":[{"name":"question_43129159","type":"multi_value_single_select","values":[{"label":"Yes, I intend to work remotely.","value":167722405},{"label":"No, I intend to work from an office location.","value":167722406}]}]}],"location_questions":[]}
