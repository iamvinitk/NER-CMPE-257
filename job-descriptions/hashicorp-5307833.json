This includes a variety of websites like hashicorp.com, developer.hashicorp.com and more. For many of HashiCorp’s customers and users, the Web Presence team delivers their first experience with the company and so it’s crucial we set high standards.\nAlong with the rest of HashiCorp, we know we can't succeed without each team member being successful - a great team culture is something that is constructed by actual experiences, not through words alone. HashiCorp's Principles are referenced in our day-to-day work and aren't just \"words on the wall\".\nOur team believes that “working in the open” makes us all better. This means that we often write down and collaborate on ideas before we start writing code. We embrace proofs of concept that communicate the core of an idea and often start the “imperfect” version of something first to collect feedback. Iteration and progressive improvement makes our work adaptable, modular, and ultimately better.\nGiven the breadth of web properties our team manages, there’s a wide range of work on this team. Our projects range from frontend-heavy marketing initiatives with interactive graphics and complex animations, to implementing and evolving HashiCorp’s design system, to backend systems architecture, to fullstack feature development that directly impacts HashiCorp users.\nWe encourage individual autonomy and keep processes minimal. We value flexibility, prioritize asynchronous communication, and adjust workflows as needed depending on the needs of the project or team. We have unique challenges across the stack to work on and you’ll get a say in what is compelling for your interests and growth. \nAbout the project\nWe are looking for a senior engineer to join the team working on hashicorp.com and directly contribute to our monorepo. Our web experience is our most important tool to tell a cohesive and clear story about our product and company. We partner with Marketing, Design, and various other stakeholders to shape the user journey and build out experiences that delight our visitors.  We look for opportunities that enrich our go-to-market strategies that directly contribute to our sales pipeline, product adoption, and revenue.\nIn this role you can expect to…\n\nContribute maintainable, well-tested, accessible and well-documented code to the repositories and systems that power HashiCorp’s website.\nWork closely with a wide variety of internal collaborators - designers, field marketers, product marketers, growth marketers, partner marketers, leadership, and more.\nReview and refactor code — help those around you grow through mentorship and pairing.\nIndependently and collaboratively identify user (both internal and external) problems  and advocate for pragmatic, iterative solutions through prototypes and written proposals. \nCollaborate in product discovery and early design to assess technical feasibility.\nIn close step with designers, execute front-end projects with meticulous polish.\nCommunicate technical opinions and project rationale to other engineers and leadership. \nManage in-flight project dependencies between cross-collaborators, take decisive action to contain project scope, and shepherd work with care through delivery. \nDuring execution, work ‘in the open’, sharing your thoughts, ideas, blockers, and code freely with others on the team.\n\nYou may be a good fit for our team if you have…\n\n6+ years of full stack development experience, with an emphasis on the front-end.\nDeep expertise and experience with React and React frameworks like Next.js.\nExperience with TypeScript & Node.js.\nFluency with HTML, CSS and modern JavaScript standards.\nKnowledge and familiarity with modern digital design and prototyping tools (like Figma).\nExperience and comfort with Git and version control.\nUnderstanding of and experience with unit, integration and end-to-end testing.\nExperience working with REST APIs.\nExperience working with a CMS - bonus points for headless.\nProven experience working iteratively and collaboratively with other teams to craft engineering solutions that solve user and business problems.\nDemonstrated experience building high quality web experiences from inception to completion that are accessible, performant, responsive and scalable.\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills.\n\nAbout You…\n\nCurious, creative and collaborative. You approach problems incrementally, taking a pragmatic approach without premature optimization or abstraction.\nSomeone who likes communicating your ideas, planning to tackle something in prose, and workshopping it with teammates before you start writing code.\nComfortable with ambiguity and approach problems with a learning mindset. \nOpen-minded, you enjoy collaborating across teams (engineering, design, product, marketing and more) and differing levels of experience, from junior engineers to VPs.\nWilling to form well-considered, strong opinions, share those opinions, listen to others' opinions, and be open to changing your mind sometimes.\nA person who desires direct, clear, and kind feedback, and is willing to give the same to others, even when it's hard to do.\nA person who values the flexibility that comes with a remote team, while recognizing the extra effort that everyone has to put into communication and relationship-building.\n\nWe're not dogmatic about the tools we use and are constantly learning as a team. We believe strongly in learning, so deep prior experience with our tools of choice isn't strictly necessary, but you should be sure that you are open to learning them.\nOur offer…\n\nYou will be part of a well-supported, skilled team where your long-term personal and professional growth are prioritized.\nA fully remote culture. HashiCorp has been a distributed company since the beginning. Read more about How HashiCorp Works.\nA trust-based work environment where expectations are set clearly, and you're given the space to fulfill them.
