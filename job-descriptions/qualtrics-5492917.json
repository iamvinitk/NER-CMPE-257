But we are more than a platform. We are the creators and stewards of the Experience Management category serving over 18,000 clients globally. Building a category takes grit, determination, and an appreciation for the unconventional—but most of all it requires close-knit, high-functioning teams with an unwavering dedication to serving our customers. When you join one of our teams, you’ll be part of a nimble group that’s empowered to set ambitious goals and move fast to achieve them. Strategic risks are encouraged, and complex problems are solved by collaborating and iterating until the best solution comes to light.

In this role, you will work with business and technical decision makers from our largest accounts, as well as Qualtrics’ technology partners and account teams.\nSolutions Architects engage early in the project lifecycle where the customer is just beginning to define the vision, and often lean on the Solutions Architect to imagine what is possible and determine if it’s feasible.

Building strong relationships with our customers' key decision-makers and understanding their business requirements will be crucial to guide the design and implementation of solutions that drive measurable business outcomes.

You will have the opportunity to collaborate with a diverse and talented team and participate in cross-functional projects that span different industries and geographies. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to contribute to the product roadmap and shape the future of our solutions, further enhancing your skills and expertise.\nThings You'll Do:\n\nLead project discovery and design sessions, including project scoping to ensure alignment between the customer's needs and Qualtrics services/ solutions.\nValidate and articulate business impact of the solution to key technical and business decision-makers at customer organizations. \nDesign customized and compelling technical solutions that align with customers' business objectives, especially at the Enterprise level.\nCollaborate closely with sales, delivery, engineering and other teams to deliver strong outcomes.\nStay up to date with industry trends and provide insights and recommendations to drive innovation.\nTake ownership of opportunities, manage multiple projects, and adapt to changes in a fast-paced environment.\nMaintain technical excellence through continuous learning and adoption of emerging technologies.\n\nWhat We're Looking for on Your Resume:\n\n3-8 years of experience in a pre-sales environment, shaping complex technology solutions.\nBachelor's or equivalent degree. Majors in a technical discipline are valued.\nStrong solution design experience or experience implementing custom solutions for enterprise customers.\nDeep understanding of cloud computing technologies, emerging trends, and their business implications.\nExcellent written and verbal communication skills.\nExperience in software design, application design, systems operations/management, database architecture, IP networking, storage, or IT security.\n\nWhat You Should Know about this Team: \nOur team is a dynamic and collaborative group of professionals who are passionate about delivering innovative solutions to our customers. We value creativity, teamwork, and a customer-centric approach. We believe in challenging the status quo and continuously pushing the boundaries of what is possible.
