Computers may be our most powerful tools, but most of us can't build or modify the software we use on them every day. At Notion, we want to change this with focus, design, and craft.\nWe've been working on this together since 2016, and have customers like Pixar, Mitsubishi, Figma, Plaid, Match Group, and thousands more on this journey with us. Today, we're growing fast and excited for new teammates to join us who are the best at what they do. We're passionate about building a company as diverse and creative as the millions of people Notion reaches\nAbout The Role\nImagine yourself in the 1970s or 80s thinking through how computing should look and feel for people who had never seen one before.

You observe and internalize all inputs and feedback to help you reach an optimal decision and prioritize wisely.\nYou have a deep understanding of research methods such as focus groups, MaxDiff, brand tracking, segmentation, campaign evaluation, in-depth interviews, conjoint analysis, etc. as well as experience with data analysis software such as SPSS or R, and survey programming tools such as Qualtrics\nHands-on experience independently designing and running both quantitative and qualitative research from beginning to end, including questionnaire / discussion guide creation, survey programming, sampling, data analysis (data cleaning, weighting, etc.), and reporting\n\nNice to Haves:\n\nMasters or PhD Degree in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Behavioral Economics, Anthropology, Sociology, or similar.\nPassion for working and learning in a fast-growing company.\nExperience with SQL or Python\nExperience communicating research to executive stakeholders\nYou're familiar with the work of computing heroes like Douglas Engelbart, Alan Kay, Bret Victor, etc. — and understand why we're big fans.\n\nWe hire talented and passionate people from a variety of backgrounds because we want our global employee base to represent the wide diversity of our customers.
