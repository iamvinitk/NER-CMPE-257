At Samsara, we are helping improve the safety, efficiency and sustainability of the physical operations that power our global economy. Representing more than 40% of global GDP, these industries are the infrastructure of our planet, including agriculture, construction, field services, transportation, and manufacturing — and we are excited to help digitally transform their operations at scale.\nWorking at Samsara means you’ll help define the future of physical operations and be on a team that’s shaping an exciting array of product solutions, including Video-Based Safety, Vehicle Telematics, Apps and Driver Workflows, Equipment Monitoring, and Site Visibility. As part of a recently public company, you’ll have the autonomy and support to make an impact as we build for the long term. \nRecent awards we’ve won include:\nGlassdoor's Highest-Rated Tech Companies for Culture and Values 2023\nGreat Place To Work Certified™ 2023\nBest Place to Work by Built In 2023\nFinancial Times The Americas’ Fastest Growing Companies 2023\nDeloitte Fast 500 Companies\nWe see a profound opportunity for data to improve the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of operations, and hope you consider joining us on this exciting journey. About the Role\nSamsara has several emerging Channel programs that have the potential to drive significant growth for the company. Some of these include our Insurance Partners, Resale Partners, Referral Partners, and Technology Integration Partners. \nAs a Partnership Sales Engineer, you will be working closely with our Partner Account managers and be responsible for leading technology conversations with existing and potential Partners and customers. \nBeing able to navigate what is needed to create success for the Partner is essential. This person will be an expert with Samsara products, features, and APIs. Using their expertise, this person will be expected to do deep discovery into the Partner environment to: (A) find solution fit, (B) determine integration level of effort, and (C) assess further technology driven revenue opportunities. It will be common to need to learn a Partner’s ecosystem by learning their products and processes and relating that back into opportunities with Samsara’s solution set.\nThis is a dynamic, entrepreneurial role that requires working cross-functionally to build partner engagements from scratch. The role (and team) has strong potential for growth along with our partner programs.\nThe role is remote but based in Mexico City.\n\nYou should apply if: \n\nYou want to make a difference: Your efforts will result in real-world impact—helping to keep the lights on, get food into grocery stores, and most importantly, ensure workers return home safely.\nYour mantra is #alwaysbeprospecting: The world of operations is vast.

Samsara’s top reps do constant research to find companies and contacts to expand their pipeline. \nYou have innate curiosity in how businesses work: One day you’ll meet with someone in waste management and the next you may be learning about the inner workings of a food distribution center. Our top sales team members seek to learn the ins and outs of the businesses they support in order to make a larger impact. \nYou build genuine relationships with your customers: The industries we serve have relied on pen-and-paper solutions for years and haven’t been met with the type of technology we offer. Our customers value earned trust and human relationships built over time.\nYou want to be with the best: Samsara’s high-performance culture means you’ll be surrounded by the best and challenged to go farther than you have before. \n\nThis may not be the right role for you if: \n\nYou aren’t willing to put in the work: Samsara sales are complex. You will need to learn about businesses where you previously had little knowledge. The payoff is big but you have to be willing to put in the work. \nYou aren’t a team player: At Samsara, sales is a team sport. We help each other out by sharing best practices and focus on winning as a team.\nYou have nothing more to learn: Every Samsarian has a growth mindset and believes that what got us here won’t get us there.\n\nClick here to learn about what we value at Samsara.\nIn this role, you will focus on\n\nDriving engagement with our Mexico based Partners.\nFinding solution fit with Partners and foster new technology focused opportunities\nDeveloping relationships with key Partners, and become an expert on Partner environments and solutions\nWorking closely with Product Management, and other relevant teams, to develop and maintain integrations with Partners.
