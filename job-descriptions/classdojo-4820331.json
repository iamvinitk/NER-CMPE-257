ClassDojo’s flagship app is the #1 communication app connecting K-8 teachers, children, and families, globally. They use it to share what’s happening throughout the day through photos, videos, messages, and activities. It is actively used at an unprecedented scale: in over 95% of US schools, reaching ~51 million children in ~180 countries, with a team of just ~200 people [1]). We are now beginning to use this network to give kids the best learning experiences in the world, far beyond those a standard school can provide. \nWe hire for talent density. Our team comprises the most talented, entrepreneurial, and innovative teammates from around the world, with experience in education and large scale consumer internet companies, including Instagram, Netflix, Dropbox, Stripe, Uber, Y Combinator, and more.

You’ll work at both a strategic and tactical level, turning data, research, and intuition into products and experiences that tens of millions of children will love.\nYou will be a match if:\n\nYou have at least 4 years of experience in product management.\n\nYou might be a good fit if:\n\nYou’ve achieved product-market fit with new consumer products\nYou have experience as a founder, or an equivalent level of accountability\nYou’ve monetized consumer products, ideally subscription products or marketplaces\nYou have a strong grasp of product strategy\nYou have strong product intuition, and good taste\nYou enjoy speaking with customers, and conducting qualitative user research to inform direction\nYou have strong quantitative skills and comfort with evaluation\nYou work well in resource-constrained environments\nYou move faster than is comfortable—you are an instigator\nYour written and spoken communication is clear and concise\n\n \n[1] Some more context:\n- ClassDojo's $125m Series D (Forbes) and Sam’s note about it.\n- ClassDojo is one of Y Combinator’s Top 100 companies\n- ClassDojo's Second Act Comes with First Profits (TechCrunch) and Sam's note about it.\nWe are committed to equal employment opportunity regardless of race, color, ancestry, religion, sex, national origin, sexual orientation, age, citizenship, marital status, disability, gender identity or Veteran status. In accordance with the San Francisco Fair Chance Ordinance, we will consider for employment qualified applicants with arrest and conviction records.
