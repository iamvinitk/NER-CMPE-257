Customer service teams from more than 25,000 global organizations, including Atlassian, Amazon and Microsoft, use Intercom to send over 600 million messages per month and enable interactions with over 800 million monthly active end users.

They are stitched into the way we work, interact with others, and hold ourselves accountable. We‚Äôre eager to hire individuals who are passionate about our mission, deeply aligned with our values, and are excited to help shape the future of customer service.What's the opportunity? ü§î\nYou will do meaningful product design work at a highly admired product-driven company that's driving real change in the industry.\nEach senior product designer at Intercom works in a team with a product manager, up to 6 engineers, and some also work directly with research and analytics. Together they own a part of Intercom, ship solutions to challenging problems and get feedback directly from customers.\nWe've had designers in key leadership roles, including at the exec level, from the very beginning. This has made design a core foundation of our company's DNA. This means that you'll never have to justify the importance of design.\nWe genuinely care about people and value kindness in our everyday interactions. You'll be able to be yourself, feel valued, supported, learn and grow no matter how experienced you are.\nIf you want to learn more about what it's like to work here, check out intercom.design, read what makes us different, and watch a keynote from our CEO talking about our mission, vision and the next chapter of Intercom.\nWhat will I be doing? üöÄ\n\n\nAct as a leader within the Product Design team, collaborating with other designers to make their work and the whole team better\n\n\nWork through design problems from beginning to end, translating insights from research and analytics into concepts that form disruptive new products and features, and designing the detailed workflows and interactions required to make them a reality.\n\n\nCollaborate with designers across the organisation to raise the quality bar and continuously improve Intercom‚Äôs design processes, principles, and tooling.\n\n\nSketch and prototype ideas to quickly assess their viability, and design the fine-grained details of components, interactions, and transitions.\n\n\nPartner with product managers to define and evolve product roadmaps.\n\n\nWork closely with engineers as you build, iterate on, and ship ideas.\n\n\nWrite about, present, and share what you‚Äôre learning, both internally and with the wider community via our blog, books, and events.\n\n\nWhat skills and experience do I need? üìñ\nSee what we look for when we hire designers\n\n\nExperience designing digital products and systems, not just websites. You have helped ship products that solve real problems, and that people use.\n\n\nAn appreciation of the entire product development process, from problem solving and system modelling, through to detailed UI, visual, and interaction design.\n\n\nAbility to design polished, high-fidelity mockups of your solutions using modern design tools such as Figma and Sketch.\n\n\nAbility to create interactive prototypes using tools like Figma, Framer, Invision, and Keynote, or in the browser with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n\nStrong communication skills to help people across the company understand the rationale behind your proposals, and the complex nuances of design problems.\n\n\nMotivated self-starter who can deeply collaborate with other disciplines including product management, engineering, research, and analytics.\n\n\nA growth mindset. Willingness to own problems. Comfort with ambiguity. A desire to make things better. A balanced sense of optimism and humility.\n\n\nYour experience should ideally focus on designing software products, and your portfolio should clearly outline the problems you‚Äôve taken on with your design work. It should touch on the process you applied to find solutions and overcome challenges, rather than focusing just on visual polish, or the final deliverables.\nBenefits üòç\nWe are a well treated bunch, with awesome benefits!
